            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>my ſtrength for nought and in vain</hi>—And this, not only as to their Oral labours in the Pulpit (whither for moſt part, they bring their Sermons, as People do their dead to Church, to bury them there); But alſo their ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate writings, and elucubrations, whereby many of God's faithful ſervants though they are dead yet ſpeak</p>
            <p>This I ſay again, is a ſore evil, and

ſhould be for a Lamentation, that ſo little right uſe is made of that ſtore of ſpiritual proviſion, which God's <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> have laid in for a time of ſcarcity; and the greater ſin, becauſe ſo little layd to heart, ſo rarely lamented.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes obſerved it to be (and I hope in ſincerity) the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſome Chriſtians, that they have heard unprofitably: but 'tis rare to meet with him that will ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his neglect of, or unprofitableneſs in reading, either the Word of God, or the works and labours of his ſervants, written for their edification; as if theſe laſt were not among thoſe Talents, which ought to be improved, and muſt certainly be accounted for.</p>
            <p>Give me leave therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> firſt to propoſe ſomething in general for thy more profitable improvement of theſe precious mercies which God puts into thy hands, I mean the pious and practical Books, which this age hath brought forth in ſuch plenty: and then a word or two in particular touching theſe two Mites which I now caſt into the common treaſury.</p>
            <p>As to the former, I hope it may be a

               <hi>to have thoſe things alwayes in remembrance,</hi> to which, while living, they did ſtir thee up, by putting thee in remembrance: Others are legally dead, and may not ſpeak, as formerly, from the Pulpit; Yet their hands are not ſo tyed up, but that they may write and (by the indulgence of Authority) make publick ſuch things, as rightly improved may promote thy ſpiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>To loſe the benefit of theſe advantages, cannot but be an unſpeakable loſs, and therefore to direct thee any way for thy more profitable uſe thereof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be acceptable to every ſoul that's under a ſenſe of his own neceſſity, of the preſent ſcarcity of quicking means in many places, and of the ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one day to be rendred of every Talent we have received, and amongſt others the pious labours of God's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants.</p>

Conſider alſo thy leiſure and opportunity (I may add alſo thy ability) All have not the like time to ſpare for this exerciſe; their imployments in the world take them up ſo, that they cannot give themſelves to reading, as thoſe may whoſe callings are more ingenuous, or whoſe Condition in the world ſets them above the neceſſity of toyling and labouring for the meat that periſheth: Theſe later may imploy their leiſure in larger Treatiſes, but the former muſt content themſelves with thoſe more ſuccinct Epitome's of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty.</p>
            <p>3. But to come nearer what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; Whenever thou ſet'ſt upon this duty or exerciſe, propoſe to thy ſelf a right end, and labour that thy reading may conduce thereunto. Want of this,
<pb facs="tcp:48822:6"/>
I fear, makes many a great Student ſo unprofitable to himſelf and others. Alas! How many propoſe no better ends to themſelves then to ſatisfy their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, to furniſh themſelves with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or matter of diſcourſe, or to drive away time (as they ſpeak) when they know not how to imploy themſelves otherwiſe? I fear ſome do but only fill up the vacancies of the Sabbath with reading, becauſe they have then (as ſome fooliſhly call it) an idle time, and know not how to ſpend it, being aſhamed or afraid to go to their ſports or worldly imployments: It hath ſometimes grieved me to ſee a Bible or good Book in the hands of ſome upon a Lord's day to ſo little purpoſe. Well, if you would profit by reading, propoſe right ends, and theſe either.</p>
            <p>1. General ſuch as agree to all good Books, namely your own edification, and the benefit of others. When you open your Bibles, or other practical Books, think thus; I have now a price in my hand; this exerciſe may, through the bleſſing of God, conduce to my eternal good: hereby my knowledge of God, of Chriſt, of my ſelf, of
<pb facs="tcp:48822:7"/>
my duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be augmented, my graces improved my Corruptions mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and for theſe ends I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to improve it. Were our eye fixt on ſuch ends, our reading would be abundantly more advantagious.</p>
            <p>2. Beſides you may propoſe to your ſelf a more ſpecial end, namely that which the Book, or ſubject ye read are directed to: as in reading a Treatiſe of Prayer, your end ſhould be to inform your judgement in the nature of that duty, to quicken your ſelf to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Make that your end in reading, which is the Author's in writing, and take notice how every Doctrine, Precept, Motive, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conduceth thereunto. This will both make the things you read better underſtood, and eaſilyer remembred; and hereby alſo more advantage will accrue to you, as to the practiſe of thoſe particular duties.</p>
            <p>4. Next ſee that you read in a right manner, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Read attentively and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately: See that your mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding go along with you. <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 8. 20.</note> 
               <hi>thou what thou readeſt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48822:7"/>
is a neceſſary Queſtions; and this cannot be without attention. What the Apoſtle ſaith in reference to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of others, <hi>I had rather ſpeak</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 19.</note> 
               <hi>five words with my underſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue,</hi> I may allude to in this caſe. A little read with deliberation, and underſtandingly, is better then whole volums poſted over without taking heed to the ſcope and meaning. Therefore labour to keep your mind, as well as your eye, at work in this exerciſe: 'Twas <hi>Plato</hi> (if I miſtake not) that required in his Schollars <hi>(Mathematicum ingenium)</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical diſpoſition, that is, To have their minds attentive and conſiderate; without this you do but pour water into a Sieve: There's much variety of men's diſpoſitions in this reſpect; Some very quick to apprehend, their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings like water, eaſily yielding to any impreſſion, but very fluid and unapt to retain; Others hardlyer imrreſs, but more happily retentive of what is once taken in; both ſorts have need to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the latter that they may get,
<pb facs="tcp:48822:8"/>
ſomething to lay up; the former, that they may lay up and keep what they get. Curſory glances, are but looking one's face in a glaſs, and then going away<note place="margin">Jam. 1, 23,</note> and forgetting what manner of men we are.</p>
            <p>2. Read judiciouſly and with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Weigh things in the Ballance. The Apoſtle often calls upon thoſe to whom he writes to uſe their own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.</note> 
               <hi>Judge ye what I ſay.</hi> And again<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 13.</note> judge in your ſelves. Is it comely—Though in reading or hearing the word of God, and the works of men there's a difference: We may read men's, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<note place="margin">Alios ut judex, Scripturan ut judi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; yet even in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is diſcretion and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be uſed, not whereby we judge what's true or falſe, but what's our duty, and vnder what circumſtances &amp;c. But in reading men's writings, even the beſt, there's great need of weighing things, eſpecially as to the application of them to our ſelves; leſt that which is intended for Phyſick to ſome, become Poyſon to others, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application:
<pb facs="tcp:48822:8"/>
But that which I mainly intend here, is the ſame which is ſo highly commended in the Beroeans: that<note place="margin">Act. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

This is that which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would eſpecially commend to you, in the reading (as well as hearing) men's diſcourſes; Take them to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, weigh them in the ſanctuary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance, <hi>To the Law and to the</hi>

Paſs not over the Material Scripture-quotations, but turn to them in your Bibles, ſee how they enforce the duty, confirm the Truth, forbid the ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is inſiſted on; By this means you ſhall not only grow into more acquaintance with the word of God, but ſee with your own eyes, and drink (not out of the Ciſtern but)<note place="margin">Dulc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>for we have heard him ourſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world:</hi> This is that which I would eſpecially commend to you.</p>
            <p>3. Read orderly and Methodically: take things before you: The beauty of Truths lies in their connexion: here and there a ſnatch will edify little: you may get ſome notions, but you loſe the main end of the work: <hi>Method</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly called <hi>the Mother of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It may be, ſome Pieces of a work may ſeem leſs uſefull, but they add light to the reſt: The opening and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a Text, drawing out the ſenſe from the Original fountains, giving the ſeveral gloſſes and opinions of men, and comparing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we find out the Truth, may ſeem leſs edifying, yet is as neceſſary as laying a good foundation, in order to a firm building: The underſtanding is to be informed, and convinced, as well as the affections to be moved, and the heart perſwaded. Therefore ſee
<pb facs="tcp:48822:9"/>
how the foundation is layd, how Truths are deduced, how opened and confirmed: I may fitly compare a practical Book (eſpecially Sermons) to a feaſt: the firſt courſe may not ſo pleaſe the appetite, but commonly conſiſts of more nouriſhing and ſolid meats, the laſt diſhes may reliſh more upon the Palate, they may more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the affections, but if you feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them alone, you ſhall not receive ſuch ſolid nouriſhment by them.</p>
            <p>4. As your occaſions permit, read conſtantly: I know worldly entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great impediment to this exerciſe, but let Chriſtians redeem what time they can for it: Make it not only a Sabbath's work; but, as much as can be, an every Day's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: a Page or two may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment in your imployments.</p>
            <p>Long intermiſſions wear off what you have gotten <hi>(Nulla dies ſine Lineâ)</hi> no day without a Line or two: I will conclude this with the application of a Rule to this purpoſe which I have ſomewhere met with about eating.
<pb facs="tcp:48822:10"/>
               <hi>Saepe, parum,</hi> lentè, nunquam ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;<note place="margin">Comenii Schola Ludu.</note> aurea lex eſt.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Eat oft, but Sparingly, and ſlowly feed,</l>
               <l>Ne're cloy thy ſelf: a golden Rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This obſerv'd in reading would make it more profitable. Frequency would beget an attentive mind, and cauſe a retentive memory, eſpecially if you do not tire the mind, nor overwhelm the memory with too much at once, and neither go on faſter, nor proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than both mind and memory may keep pace with you. This for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reading.</p>
            <p>5. In the next place labour to rivett and faſten things upon your ſelves; do as the Apoſtle exhorts in reference to hearing; <hi>Give the more earneſt heed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to the things which you have heard leſt at any time you ſhould let them ſlip,</hi> leſt they ſhould leak out (as out of a crack't Veſſel, ſo the word imports) or runne abroad as ink up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naughty Paper. 'Tis grand folly
<pb facs="tcp:48822:10"/>
to take ſome pain's to get, what we quickly forget. Some have made Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be nothing elſe but remembrance: I am ſure, without remembrance we are but like thoſe <hi>ſilly Women, ever</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>learning, and never coming to the knowledg of the Truth.</hi> Memory is the repoſitory of what the underſtanding takes in. Now that things read may ſtick faſter, I commend two things eſpecially.</p>
            <p>1. Recollection and After<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſumme up what you have read, eſpecially the ſubſtance and matter of it, nor once but often: food needs a manifold concoction, before it be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our ſubſtance; It muſt be chewed with the Teeth in order to concoction, then carried down into the Stomack where it receives a change (as it were) being turned into that which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician calls <hi>Chyle;</hi> the pureſt of this<note place="margin">

               </note>
               <pb facs="tcp:48822:11"/>
and turned into our very ſubſtance: you ſee how much comes betwixt eating, and receiving nouriſhment. If Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,<note place="margin">Add, here, that it would be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to write down the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, and often to peruſe it, if thou canſt write, and haſt leiſure for it.</note> Liver, or any other part fails in its office, the food, we take in, nouriſhes not, yea often turnes into diſeaſes; ſo it is with the food of our ſouls, it muſt be digeſted, concocted, we muſt ruminate upon it, and (with the clean beaſt) often chew the cud, if we would be nouriſht thereby. Well then, lay not aſide the thoughts of what you read, with the Books but either immediately, or upon the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumity, recall what you can, and (which is the advantage of reading above hearing) review the ſubſtance of what is gone out of your mind. This will be found a very thriving way.</p>
            <p>2. But add practiſe and exerciſe to all this: things are never your own, till they be put in practiſe. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have made nature the layer of the foundation, Doctrine or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Builder; but exerciſe the Perfecter, that lays the Topſtone, of any good habit, Art, or Science: This is the end of knowledge, and without it you know not in Gods account what
<pb facs="tcp:48822:11"/>
you do know: <hi>He judged the cauſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 22. 16.</note> 
               <hi>of the poor and needy, then it was well with him: Was not this to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 22.</note> 
               <hi>know me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> This is indeed to know: without this, you read but to your own greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> you do but put a cheat and fallacy upon your own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you ſet upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any practical Book, look upon it as a Tutour to teach you ſomething of your Duty as Chriſtians; take out thoſe leſſons that are proper for you, and ſet about the Practiſe of them.</p>
            <p>6. I ſhall adde but one thing more, but that without which the reſt will be fruitleſs and ineffectual, namely, before and after this exerciſe lift up your hearts to God in prayer, <hi>He it is that muſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 17.</note> 
               <hi>teach you to profit,</hi> he gives under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſtrengthens memory, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens affections, and makes the labours of his ſervants profitable: begge the concurrence of his holy Spirit before you enter upon the duty, and turn the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of what you read into Prayer. When you underſtand your duty, go to him for ſtrength to perform it. When you meet with ſomething that's convincing,
<pb facs="tcp:48822:12"/>
quickning, comforting, intreat the Lord to ſet it home and keep it upon your hearts.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, in ſome weak meaſure, propoſed what ſeems moſt conducing to the prefitable reading of both of the Scriptures, and other labours of God's ſervants, which I hope may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe a word in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Concerning this two fold Treatiſe, I ſhall not ſay much: The dignity of the ſubject, I confeſs, required an able<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The later Treatiſe is an Expoſition (if you pleaſe ſo to call it) upon the Lord's Prayer, with ſome (and but ſome) Obſervations, and the brief ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them, The Method accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the end of the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is, to be our Pattern in Prayer.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is noted by <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 10. as the property of wicked men, to <hi>ſpeak evil of things they know not.</hi> What's ſaid of Malice, that it never ſpeaks well; is often true of ignorance; it ſeldom ſpeaks well, eſpecially of ſpiritual things; which are not more above the knowledge of ignorant and carnal men, than contrary to their inclinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48822:29"/>Amongſt the duties of Chriſtian Religion, as there is none more excellent and ſpiritual, than that of prayer, rightly and ſpiritually performed, (being a familiar converſe, and near approach to the Moſt High;) ſo, none hath met with more ſcoffs and deriſion, from the prophane and blind world. For though few that bear the name of Chriſtian, will be ſo palpably Atheiſtical, as to deny it to be a duty; having, beſides the clear and expreſs injunctions of Scripture, the light of natural Reaſon atteſting it; yet how many would ſtrip the power from the form, and turn it into a meer lip-ſervice, and fruitleſs babling? For what better is it, to utter words without affections and Graces? And what affections can be ſpiritually excited, or Graces exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, without the helps of Gods Spirit? Yet what more ordinary amongſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner ſort, than to jeer at praying by the Spirit, as if it were a ridiculous fantaſie; or that ordinary Chriſtians could have no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, but they muſt preſently run into pretended Impulſes and Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmes.</p>
               <p>To ſilence (if poſſible) theſe blaſphemers; and however, to evince the Truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing; to encourage the Godly to hold on their courſe; to ſhew them where the ſtrength and prevalency of this duty lyes, how great their Priviledge is in this reſpect; is the deſign of this undertaking. The Scripture I have choſen, is full and pregnant, and will, I hope, with its light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48822:29"/>
and power, bear down all thoſe carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, which are exalted againſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Truth.</p>
               <p>That my way into it may be the clearer; you may take notice, that the ſcope of the Chapter, is to comfort Believers; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the precious Priviledges they are inveſted with by Chriſt; and what an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſpring of Conſolation, he is to thoſe, that are ſavingly ingraffed into him, even againſt all that might trouble or terrifie them.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there are two principal ſprings, whence all the ſorrows of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flow; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Reliques of Sin within. 2. The Preſſures of Affliction without. The Apoſtle layes in comfort againſt each of theſe ſeverally: Againſt ſin remaining, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 17. Againſt afflictions preſſing, from <hi>v.</hi> 18. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Text is one of thoſe Cordials, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent faintings under any kind of ſuffering, (though not leſs Soveraign againſt the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of corruption) and indeed very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and heart-cheering to thoſe that enjoy it: namely that they have the Spirit of God to help them in pouring out their complaints, and begging what's needful for them at the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Though I intend not, the diſtinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of every particular Truth coucht in theſe words; yet, it will not be amiſs to open them, that you may be the better able, to glean up, not thoſe ſingle cars only, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48822:30"/>
whole ſheaves of Goſpel-Truth, which I ſhall leave behind me.</p>
               <p>In the words then, is ſet forth a precious Priviledge of Gods people, which (though enjoyed in other Caſes, yet) is eſpecially beſteading in a day of affliction: namely, the Spirit enabling to, and aſſiſting in the duty of prayer. Particularly obſerve in them,</p>

               <p>1. The Author of the Priviledge, that is, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the Spirit;</hi> which what elſe can it mean, but the Spirit of God, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince its emphatically pointed out in the following clauſe, (<gap reason="foreign">

not be underſtood here of ones own Spirit? The Anſwer were eaſie; That there is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt [<hi>ſuſtaining</hi>] in that Text, and [<hi>helping</hi>] in this. There, <hi>the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whats that to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual infirmities, ignorance, unaptneſs and inability for duty? What can the natural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of a mans own ſpirit contribute to the help of theſe? Beſides that, other Texts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with this, in the ſenſe I give: Eph. 6. 18. <hi>Praying alwayes—In the Spirit, per Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, thus gloſſing; <hi>Paul</hi> would have prayers to proceed from the Holy Ghoſt: Or, if that Text may admit of another ſenſe: <hi>In the Spirit;</hi> that is, <hi>ex inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Add the conſent of Expoſitors.</note> 
                  <hi>animi penetralibus,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Beza,</hi> making it parallel with that in Eph. 5. 19. [<hi>making melody in your hearts</hi>—] Yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, that in <hi>Jude</hi> 20. (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>praying in or by the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) is above any juſt ground of exception; and cannot without manifeſt violence be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtood, but of the Holy Spirit of God, the third perſon of the Trinity, whoſe Graces they muſt exerciſe in prayer. So that I take it for undoubtedly true, that by <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> here, is meant the Spirit of God, who is the Author of this precious Priviledge.</p>
               <p>2. Here is the Priviledge it ſelf: and that is expreſſed in two or three words, very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Helpeth our Infirmities:</hi> But that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

               <p>2. There are other two words, both of one root, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <gap reason="foreign">

But here, <hi>for,</hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of another, to procure that the perſon in authority, may be propitious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to obtain, that one may bring in his plea, and may be heard by the Judge. Which yet is ſo to be underſtood, not as if the Holy Spirit did intercede with the Father or Son for us (as the <hi>Arians</hi> affirmed;) but, that he<note place="margin">Beza.</note> excites us to pray; and as it were dictates ſighs and expreſſions to us: Whence he is ſaid, to <hi>cry, Gal.</hi> 4. 6. and by it we are ſaid to <hi>cry, Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Of this more anon.</p>
               <p>3. Here is the manner of this Priviledge, (for ſo I chooſe to call it) how the Spirit makes interceſſion, <hi>viz. with groanings which</hi>

Thus it is ſometimes with a child of God, eſpecially under ſad afflictions, bound up (as to expreſſion) and cannot go forth, Pſal. 88. 8. <hi>He remembers God and is troubled, he complains, and his ſpirit is overwhelmed,</hi> Pſal. 77. 3. Yet even this is prayer, and from the Spirit of God: Not that this is the only way of the Spirits aſſiſtance: ſometimes he fills the mouth as well as the heart, enables
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48822:32"/>
the ſoul to vent it ſelf, in full and ſuitable Confeſſions and Petitions, to approach God with an holy confidence. But here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (if we ſo take the words) ſeems to ſpeak of the loweſt aſſiſtances of the Spirit, when 'tis worſt with a child of God in his own apprehenſion, when under heavy preſſures, and cannot pour out his ſoul; yet he can ſigh and groan out his ſorrows, can chatter as the Crane or Swallow, mourn as a Dove; and yet even this (when from the Spirit) is comfortable.

               <p>1. The Spirit inſpires not ordinary Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as it did the Prophets and Apoſtles in the delivery of the Scriptures. <hi>Holy men of old were moved (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) carried, acted by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. So that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, Sermons, Prayers recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are purely divine; Words, Matter, Method, from the Spirit of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infallibly true, free from any fault, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion; or miſtakes in matter, form, phraſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis not ſo with Chriſtians.

the Spirits aſſiſtance, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may have many failings, much corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, indiſcretion, diſorder, raſhneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mixt with them.</p>
               <p>2. Muchleſs doth the Spirit ſo help, as if we were meerly Paſſive, and the Spirit were active; as if the Spirit only made uſe of our tongues (as the Devil uſes the Organs of<note place="margin">Non quòd ipſe revera ſuppliciter ſe ad precan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum vel gemendum demittat, &amp;c. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi> per vos, intra vos.</note> thoſe he poſſeſſeth, to vent his lies and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies withal.) This is a groſſer conceit and abſurdity, than to be charged on the Spirit of God. It may ſeem indeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 20. as if the Spirit uſed the Organs of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: our Saviour tells them, <hi>It is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father, which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> Yet that (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in you</hi>) is no more (as <hi>Beza</hi> notes) than <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you:</hi> that is, he gives expreſſion, courage; elocution: Or as <hi>v.</hi> 19. he <hi>gives in that hour what they ſhall ſpeak:</hi> So that not the Spirit, but they ſpeak; though extraordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled at ſuch a time, both as to courage, wiſdom and elocution. Thus it was with the<note place="margin">See Acts 24.</note> Apoſtles; but the help vouchſaft to ordinary Chriſtians, lies not much (if at all) in the guidance of the Tongue, or outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
               <p>3. Nor doth the Spirit help more or otherwiſe in prayer reſpectively, than in other duties of Religion. Some, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, fancy, as if thoſe that talk of praying in or by the Spirit, had a conceit of ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular help in that duty above others. Not ſo: the ſame help is reſpectively vouchſaft
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48822:34"/>
in other duties. You read of ſinging, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerving God in the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The Spirit no leſs helps a Miniſter in preaching, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in hearing, ſinging, meditation, holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (according to the nature and requiſites of thoſe duties) than in prayer: that is, conſider what Graces and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are neceſſary in thoſe duties, and the Spirit doth equally furniſh Chriſtians there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as with praying qualifications. So that I am far from tying up the Spirit to any extraordinary Energy in this, above other duties.</p>
               <p>4. Nor doth the Spirit ſo help in this or other duties, as if other ſubordinate helps were unneceſſary. I do not believe, that our Saviours command, Matth. 10. 19. <hi>Take no</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Calv. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>thought what ye ſhall ſpeak</hi>—excludes all premeditation, but only that they ſhould not be anxiouſly ſolicitous, what to anſwer; they ſhould not wrack themſelves with fore-thoughts about it: muchleſs, doth the Spirits ordinary aſſiſtance, exclude other helps, as ſtudy, preparation, premeditation: Though the Apoſtles were extraordinarily inſpired, yet they ſtood in need of Chriſts teaching, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. Nor doth our Saviour, when they deſire to be taught to pray, tell them, that they had the Spirit, and therefore needed no inſtructions, but preſcribes them a pattern, whereby they might know to whom, for what, in what manner they ſhould pray: How much more then, is it needful, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtians, to uſe all helps for their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48822:34"/>
better enablement to this duty? To ſtudy the Word, which may furniſh them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and direct them in the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this, as well as other duties?</p>
               <p>5. Nor doth the Spirits interceſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Chriſts; they being of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and jointly neceſſary in prayer. Chriſts Interceſſion is performed in Heaven; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in our hearts: That procures accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; This provides aſſiſtance. It is fitly illuſtrated, by putting up a Petition to an Earthly King. There is difference betwixt drawing up a Petition, forming and framing it for matter and expreſſion; and betwixt preferring or preſenting it, ſpeaking to it, and pleading for it: The one may be done in the Countrey; the other, muſt be done at Court: both, are neceſſary. The like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is here: The Spirit helps (as it were) to draw the Petition, Chriſt preſents it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures audience and acceptance, pleading his own righteouſneſs to that purpoſe. This I thought good to hint Negatively, that I might take off the odious imputation of ſome, who charge this Doctrine as Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and tending to Fanaticiſme.</p>

               <p>1. In beſtowing Praying Gifts upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. In the Primitive times God gave extraordinary gifts, whereby they were able on a ſodain, in a ſtrange unknown lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to dictate a Prayer, or Pſalm.

                  </gap> ſuch gifts, are to be uſed for edification. They might <hi>pray with the Spirit, (viz.</hi> in a ſtrange Tongue which the Spirit dictated) but, they muſt <hi>pray with the underſtanding alſo i. e.</hi> ſo as they might be underſtood by, and inſtruct others. This extraordinary Gift is ceaſed; yet ſo, as that there is ſomething of this kind, ſtill beſtowed on the Church. Its well obſerved by a Learned Commentator, <q>That all miraculous gifts, are now turned<note place="margin">Manton in <hi>Jud. v. 20.</hi>
                     </note> into ordinary gifts ſomewhat like them: as diſcerning of Spirits, into a ſagacity and cautelous prudence; gifts of Tongues, into a ſpecial dexterity, that is attained by ſtudy and induſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gift of praying with the Spirit, into a readineſs of utterance and freedom of ſpeech: This then (as it is a gift) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a ſpecial dexterity, whereby men are able to put their meaning into apt words; and ſo to utter themſelves, as to affect and excite others; which (with the like gifts) is not of ſuch a miraculous and immediate infuſion, as the former; but depends much on the temper and ſuitable conſtitution of the body; and is much bettered by induſtry, hearing, reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as all other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary habits are.</q> I hope none will deny a concurrence of the Spirit with ordinary
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48822:35"/>
means, whereby they are made effectual for the attainment of edifying gifts: and this I may (without ſuſpicion of <hi>Fanaticiſme</hi>) call the gift of prayer, which (as the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Author obſerves) may be, and often is, given to carnal men for the Churches ſervice; and is uſually given according to mens conſtitution and natural receptivity:<note place="margin">There is a natural fervency. <hi>Vi. Bolton's Self-inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exam.</hi> 174.</note> So that there is a great difference betwixt one and another, in regard of quickneſs and enlargement of ſpeech. This is ſomething, but the leaſt part of that which I aim at; to which you may refer the Spirits directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, laid down in the Scripture, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty; for thereby is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thorowly furniſht for this and every other good work.</p>
               <p>2. But beſides this aſſiſtance by way of gifts, there is a higher work of the Spirit; which I call its gracious aſſiſtance, in beſtowing, exciting, exerciſing praying graces. And this is either,</p>
               <p>1. Habitual: a praying diſpoſition wrought in the heart of every Believer at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and growing up together with their Sanctification. This diſpoſition was wrought, and exerted it ſelf in <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſoon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. This new nature is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, like things of an aiery or fiery temper; a little thing carries it upward. The Spirit of Grace, is a Spirit of <hi>ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Chriſtians are made Prieſts unto God, and furniſht with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrifices, which they are to offer up unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48822:36"/>2. Beſides this, there is alſo an actual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit in prayer. It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Quickning Principle to all duties, but an Active aſſiſting Principle in this as in others.</p>
               <p>Now wherein this actual Aſſiſtance lies; is our main inquiry: and that chiefly in two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In Exciting to the Duty.</item>
                  <item>2. Enabling us in it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The Spirit helps, by exciting us to prayer: puts us in mind, gives many a ſecret jogg, beckens a child of God to his Cloſet, Pſal. 27. 8. <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek my face</hi>—Poſſibly, by ſome inward impulſes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon his Spirit, Cant. 2. 14. <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the Rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice</hi>—Such hints may a child of God ſometimes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience within. <hi>The Spirit ſaith Come,</hi> Rev. 22. 19. Theſe are ſome of thoſe motions, which we muſt not quench, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 19. And why ſhould this ſeem a melancholy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to any rational perſon? I would but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to wicked, looſe, debaucht perſons (the great deriders of this Doctrine;) Do you never feel extraordinary, violent, ſodain urgings and preſſings to wickedneſs? When it may be, you are lawfully imployed, and your thoughts upon your buſineſs, Do not unclean, wicked blaſphemous motions, ruſh in uninvited, unthought of? And are they not purſued, and kept on your hearts, with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48822:36"/>
a kind of violence, even when there is in you a kind of abhorrence and reluctancy? Whence can theſe come, think you? I deny not, but your Corruption may be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Nurſe; yet, I doubt not, the Devil is the Father of theſe Brats: they are by him begotten (as I may ſay) upon your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified concupiſcence. If the Devil can do ſo much (a Truth, which Gods deareſt children know by ſad experience, when, in their beſt performances, ſuch dreadful things are ſuggeſted;) Why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to any, that the Spirit of God, doth caſt in good motions, arguments, encouragements to duty? Yet, would I not be underſtood, as if we muſt never pray, but when we find and feel ſuch motions: thats an Artifice of the Devil, to draw us from our conſtancy in this duty; which I ſhall meet with in its due place. Mean while, let me tell you, that theſe Excitations, are not violent and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Impulſes; but ſweet Motions, agreeable to reaſon, and purſued (as it were) by reaſoning and argumentation. As,</p>
               <p>1. The Spirit excites a child of God to prayer, by ſhewing him ſome ſpecial want he lies under. This ſeems to be intimated in the Text, [<hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for] q. d.</hi> We are ignorant of our own neceſſities. Now the Spirit opens our eyes, diſcovers ſome ſtrong corruptions to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; ſome weak grace to be confirmed; ſome Temptation whereby we are in danger
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48822:37"/>
to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ſpecial Remedy. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that Thorn in his fleſh, prayes <hi>Thrice (i. e.</hi> often, earneſtly) <hi>that it may be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>taken from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Sometimes, by diſcovering the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of ſome ſpiritual good thing, grace, comfort, aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It enlightens the ſouls eyes, to ſee the beauty of Chriſt, excellency of holineſs, advantage of an heart enlarged in duty, and then opens its mouth to cry for it.</p>
               <p>3. Sometimes, by repreſenting encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prayer: lets the ſoul ſee the fulneſs and freeneſs of the Promiſes; the boldneſs and confidence it may have, by vertue of Chriſts Interceſſion, Gods readineſs to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus (as it were) beſpeaks a Chriſtian: [Why ſo backward to ask, when God is ſo ready to beſtow? Wer't thou to ask at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, or hadſt only a Peradventure to ſpeed, well mightſt thou ſtand off: but when thou haſt infallible Promiſes, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Mediator, a propitious Father to go to, Why doſt thou not ask more and oftner?]</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes, it makes uſe of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, reproaches, hard entertainments, which a Saint meets with in the world, as a ſpur to prayer. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 109. 3, 4. <hi>They have ſpoken againſt me with a lying tongue—But I give my ſelf unto prayer. Peninnah's</hi> Taunts, ſent <hi>Hannah</hi> to her prayers, 1 Sam. 1. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Sennacherib's</hi> railings, are a whet to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48822:37"/>
                  <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 19. 15. This is not a leſſon of Natures teaching; corruption would render railing for railing. 'Tis the Spirit of Grace, that turns theſe into occaſions of prayer. So for Afflictions; the more the Jews are oppreſſed, the louder is their cry: the higher theſe waters riſe, the more doth <hi>David</hi> lift up his heart and voice to God. 'Tis true, Nature teaches to cry and complain; but the Spirit of Grace turns car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal complaints, into ſpiritual breathings; gives vent this way to ſorrow.</p>
               <p>5. Sometimes, it makes uſe of Providences this way; Mercies, unexpected deliverances put the ſoul into a praying, praiſing frame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1, 2. &amp; 116. 12, 13. So Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſodain ſtrokes on our ſelves or others. Afflictions become a Whetſtone to prayer.</p>
               <p>6. (To hint one thing more) It makes others zeal, fervour, conſtancy, a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: by reading of, or hearing the ſtrugling wreſtling prayers of others, the Spirit ſtirs up a child of God; hereby it ſhames him out of his careleſneſs, lazineſs, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have hinted, to ſhew that the way of the Spirits working, in ſtirring up Chriſtians to prayer, is not phantaſtical, but agreeable to Reaſon; by argument and conviction.</p>
               <p>2. The Spirits gracious aſſiſtance, lyes alſo in beſtowing enablements for, and in, the duty. It deals not as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Task-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48822:38"/>
to require Brick, and afford no Straw: It doth not put us on, and then leave us; but it takes us by the hand, and leads us on in the duty. So much the Text intimates: It doth lift with us: and this,</p>

honourable for God to give, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for us to receive. How often would our heady paſſions, engage God in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate quarrels and revenges?

Now the Spirit ſupplies our Saviours place; it gives a check to our heady paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unlawful deſires, unwarrantable Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How are <hi>Agur's</hi> deſires regulated, and brought to a right <hi>Decorum, Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. Gods Spirit teacheth to ask, not only whats lawful in it ſelf, but whats convenient for us. Particularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. It teacheth to prefer ſpirituals before temporals; it widens our deſires that way, and ſhews us the far greater excellency and neceſſity of heavenly things; ſo that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſometimes forgets his bodily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to remember his ſoul.</p>
               <p>2. Amongſt ſpirituals, it helps to ſingle out thoſe, which are moſt needful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for us; and to be moſt importunate for things of moſt abſolute neceſſity: for grace, more than gifts or comforts: That, being neceſſary, to the Being of a Chriſtian; thoſe, but to his well-being: That, being the very foundation; thoſe, the Roof and Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Again, for Truth of grace, more than meaſures of grace; as knowing that all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48822:39"/>
meaſures are not fit for every one. And again, amongſt graces, for thoſe that are moſt uſeful, needful for himſelf in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: For thoſe which make him a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Chriſtian, rather than thoſe that ſet him off in the eye of the world. Thus the Spirit helps a child of God, to ſingle out Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, to find out acceptable words; to fetch his Petitions, nor only out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or out of his memory, but (<hi>è ſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o pectoris</hi>) from his own ſenſe and feeling; not only, to ask what he may, but what he moſt needs to ask.</p>
               <p>3. It brings to remembrance, matter ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to each part of prayer. For Inſtance, in confeſſions, it ſets our own ſins before us. How hath a gracious ſoul, been ſometimes led to confeſs, ſuch ſins, or with ſuch aggravations and circumſtances, as he hath ſcarce took notice of before, and yet ſuch as he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to lodge in him? So in Petition, how often is he carried out further than he thought of, and things caſt in, which he ſees himſelf to ſtand in great need of? The like I might ſay of Prayer for others, and of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p>4. In Petitions, the Spirit not only teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what to ask, but how to plead. And herein lies much of the Spirits aſſiſtance, in furniſhing a ſoul with powerful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing arguments. You may obſerve, what ſinews, what ſtrength of Argument, is coucht in the prayers of the Saints in Scripture: as in the prayers of <hi>Moſes, David, Daniel, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48822:39"/>
Sometimes, from the Nature and Attributes of God, his Goodneſs, Truth, Faithfulneſs. Sometimes, from the Promiſes. Sometimes, from their own miſery and help<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſsneſs: yea, the Spirit teacheth to make an argument of that, which ſeems to make againſt them: Pſal. 25. 11. <hi>Pardon my ſin, O Lord; for it is great.</hi> Here is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the greatneſs of ſin, which might rather plead againſt him: yet there is much ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>5. I may add here (though it is the leaſt part of this great Priviledge) that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, though it doth not guide the Tongue infallibly; yet it doth ſometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a child of God, even above himſelf, in fulneſs and ſuitableneſs of expreſſion; helps

him to clothe his petitions in Scripture-phraſe, and fills his mouth with words, as well as his heart with affections. But this may ſuffice, as to the Spirits help, in the matter of prayer.</p>
               <p>2. It helps, not only for matter, but for manner alſo. Something to this, lies in thoſe words of the Text [<hi>Groanings which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>1. It helps, by enlarging the affections. Words are but the outſide of prayer: Sighs and groans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the language God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands and delights in. The Spirit teacheth importunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> draws ſighs from the hearts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ears from the eyes. Parts may teach elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the neat ordering of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; (and nature it ſelf; may furniſh with ſome flaſhly and ſpurious affections: But the Spirit wings the affections, enlargeth the heart. This cauſeth reachings-forth of the ſoul after God, and enables it to wreſtle with a holy violence; ſheds abroad the love of God in the heart; widens the deſires; ſpiritualizeth our joy, grief, anger, zeal, and the reſt of the paſſions. All which are neceſſary inſtruments in prayer.</p>
               <p>2. It helps, by exciting and exerciſing its own grades; (here is its moſt proper work) theſe, lie as ſparks under the aſhes, till the Spirit of God blow them up: as it works grace, ſo it muſt ſet it at work. It is ſaid,

To inſtance in one or two of many; leaving the reſt to your own meditation.</p>
               <p>1. It fills the ſoul with a holy confidence; teaches to cry <hi>Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8. Sometimes, in the duty, Pſal. 20. 6. <hi>Now I know, that the Lord ſaveth his Anointed</hi>—Sometimes, after: <hi>Hannah's</hi> countenance clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from former ſadneſs, diſcovered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of her ſoul, that her Petition ſhould be granted. How often have the Saints riſen off their knees, with raiſed expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as if the things askt, were already given in?</p>
               <p>2. Yet it keeps the ſoul in a humble aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frame; makes it ſerious and full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Luſt would deal baſely and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontingly with God; but the Spirit makes us, <hi>take beed to our feet</hi>—and teacheth us, not to be <hi>raſh with our mouths, or haſty to utter any thing before God,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 1, 2.

to the manner of the duty.</p>
               <p>3. As it helps in the matter and manner, ſo it enables to perſevere; not only ſets us in, but carries thorow, and enables us to pray and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly touch upon two or three which are moſt obvious, and troubleſome to Gods children.</p>
               <p>1. It helps us to perſevere in prayer, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 10, 11. Gen. 32. 26. Jer. 14. 11, 13. Matth. 15. 22.</note> diſcouragements from God. Though God bid <hi>Moſes,</hi> let him alone; and <hi>Jacob,</hi> let him go; though he forbids the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to pray for the people, though our Saviour gives harſh and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging anſwers, to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet they follow on: It teaches to anſwer Objections, to read love and pity in Gods heart, when we can ſee nothing but frowns in his face: to catch faſter hold, when he ſeems to throw us off: to interpret Gods anſwers by terrible things, contrary to the natural import, and to believe and expect contrary to our ſenſe and experience, to hope againſt hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Againſt diſcouragements from our ſelves. Unbelief, ſhort-ſpiritedneſs, and the like corruptions, which would make us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48822:41"/>
break out, as he, 2 Kings 6. 33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait upon him any longer?</hi> Oh, but the Spirit ſtrengthens our faith, lengthens out our patience, beſpeaks us, in the language of <hi>David</hi> to his own ſoul, Pſal. 42. ult. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me?</hi>—</p>
               <p>3. Againſt diſcouragements from others, from the world, or from the Devil: How would men ſcoff or jeer us, out of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on God. <hi>What profit is it, that you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>keep his Ordinances, in that you walk mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> What get you by all your whining prayers, your creeping into corners? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here the Spirit comes in with ſome encouraging promiſe or experience: <hi>Yet a little while, and be that ſhall come will</hi>

I tell you, that he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi> The Devil alſo acts his part; ſometimes to diſtract us in, ſometimes to divert, or fright us from, or weary us out of this duty. Your own experience can furniſh you with ſad Inſtances of this kind, if you know what<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 11. 1 Joh. 4. 4.</note> prayer indeed is; for you are not ignorant of his Devices. But here alſo, <hi>Greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world.</hi> By the help of Gods Spirit, we perſiſt in the duty, againſt all theſe diſcouragements. And this for anſwer to the firſt Caſe.</p>

               <p>HAving thus according to the light I have; and, I hope, by the guidance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and determination of the Word of Truth, reſolved this great Caſe; the next will be this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. How may we diſcern and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the motions and aſſiſtances of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from ſome things that carry reſemblance to them? It is very neceſſary, but not very eaſie to know, from what principle we act; leſt being miſtaken, all our prayers miſcarry, and we our ſelves ſuffer loſs.</p>
               <p>Now there are four things, which are ſomething like the motions and actings of the Spirit; from which I ſhall endeavour to diſtinguiſh it.</p>

               <p>1. Satanical Impulſes: It may perhaps ſeem incredible to ſome at firſt hearing, that the Devil ſhould put men upon duty, who is the grand Enemy both to God and man; and makes it his whole buſineſs, to hinder man from communion with, and enjoyment

But how ſhall we diſcern theſe, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Spirit? I ſhall give a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference.</p>
               <p>1. Satans Impulſes, are violent, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, unreaſonable; they are cruel inſultings, not gracious excitings, nothing but terror and horror. Pray, and ſo often, and ſo long, and with ſuch a degree of ſaith, ſervour, freeneſs from diſtraction, or thou art a damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch! A rigid Exactor he is, and a cruel Task-maſter; his deſign is (ſince he cannot keep the ſoul out of duty) to run it out of breath; to over-drive the weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of the young Cattel, Gen. 33. 13.) <hi>that they may die and periſh.</hi> He turns himſelf into an Ape and imitator of Gods Spirit, that (under that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) he may diſparage Gods Spirit, as if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48822:43"/>
he were an unreaſonable Tyrant; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Gods ſervice, as worſe than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Bondage. He knows that Chriſts <hi>yoak is eaſie, and his burden light</hi> to a gracious ſoul,<note place="margin">Match. 11. 30.</note> therefore he layes on load, to break the weak Chriſtians back if poſſible; at leaſt to bring him to a grievous diſtaſte and diſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods wayes; and ſo to give the lie to the Goſpel and Miniſters thereof, who report the wayes of God, to be ſweet and pleaſant. This is a Temptation, wherewith the Devil purſues young and forward Profeſſors; with whom he deals as a Rider with a young high mettled Horſe; nor doth he only give them head, but ſpur and force them forward, till he quite tire them out: He perſwades them ſo much time muſt be ſpent in duty, as cannot conſiſt with their outward Calling; and ſo makes one duty, thruſt out, or claſh with another. But now, the Spirits moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſweet and rational, Hoſ. 2. 14. <hi>I will allure her</hi>—They are not forced, as fire from the Flint; but ſweetly drawn, as water from the Cock or Fountain. I deny not, but the Spirit of God may inforce duty, from arguments of Terror (ſuch arguments he ſometimes uſes in the Word; as <hi>Mat. 10. 28. Heb. 12. ult.</hi> and therefore may in the hearts of Believers;) But he doth allay their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and mixeth encouragements, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in thoſe and other Scripture is evident: he ſhews them the Rod, but his chief inducements are from the Love of God in Chriſt, the ſweetneſs, comfort, and advantage flowing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48822:43"/>
from duty, the equitableneſs of obeying God as our Soveraign. The Spirits moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like it ſelf, drawn moſtly from love and ingenuity. How tender is our bleſſed Saviour, of his newly initiated Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 14. He will not have <hi>a new piece put upon an old garment,</hi> or <hi>new wine into old Bottles: i. e.</hi> He will not have his young Diſciples, at firſt put upon the harder duties of faſting and mourning. <hi>He ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11. &amp; 42. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>boſome, and gently lead thoſe that are with young. He ſhall not cry, nor life up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreets. A bruiſed reed ſhall be not break</hi>—And ſuch is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to weak Believers.</p>
               <p>2. Satans Impulſes, as they are unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo they are unſeaſonable alſo. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is moſt urgent, when he ſees us the leaſt apt to duty. For inſtance:</p>
               <p>1. When he ſees us under ſome notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, outward or inward: when our graces fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g, or our bodies faint. It is reported of a good man, who had kept up a ſtrict courſe of duty, that being viſited with ſickneſs, he had mighty preſſings and urgings upon his Spirit, to hold on the ſame degree of ſervour, length and frequency in duty, which by reaſon of his bodily indiſpoſition, much weakned him; and yet feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable, he fell under ſad Terrors: till by a godly Miniſter he was told, that there was ſomething of Satan in it, and that God required Mercy not Sacrifice; that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48822:44"/>
not more, than according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtrength and ability, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>2. Or when God calls us to other duties. If he cannot keep us from duty, he makes uſe of one as a wedge to drive out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; unſeaſonably and violently urging to one, when God calls to another; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be acceptably performed. Some pious ſouls have ſeen cauſe to complain of unſeaſonable good motions: when hearing, then urged to prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, when in their worldly Callings and lawful imployments they have ſometimes had ſuch violent preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to break off and fall a praying, which at other times they would be glad of, but cannot have them: (I ſhall by and by give ſome caution here:) now his deſign is only to entangle conſcience, and make them believe they have ſleighted the motions of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>3. Or when he hath got ſome notable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt them, hath fettered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled them in ſome ſnare: He deals in this caſe, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> with <hi>Sampſon;</hi> when ſhe had bound him, and cut his Locks, then <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, the Philiſtins are upon thee, Sampſon.</hi> When he<note place="margin">Judg. 16.</note> hath ſo enſeebled a child of God, that he can ſcarce go, then he will preſs him to run. All which, is but to make Religion irkſome, to beget in the ſoul a diſreliſh of duty, and ſo to break off its courſe: or elſe, to make us laughing-ſtocks to others, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an object of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> laughter and desiſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48822:44"/>But now the Spirits motions are ſeaſonable and orderly. Like the works of God, each <hi>beautiful in it's time:</hi> It moves to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 11.</note> duty of the time; it ſets in with other occaſions and concurrent advantages. We may ſay of the Spirits motions, as of that Army, Joel 2. 7, 8 <hi>They march every one on his way, they do not break rank, neither one thruſt another, they walk every one in his own path.</hi> The Devil urges to one duty, as a diverſion from another; but the Spirit of God moves to one, as preparatory and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to another. When the heart is warmed by hearing, or put in Tune by a Providence, then it puts in a motion to the ſoul. When the ſayles are filled with a ſweet gale of heavenly breathings and inſpirations, then it bids the ſoul ſet out; and ſo makes its voyage proſperous; all its motions, are words in ſeaſon: not but that there may be,<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 23.</note> and will be oppoſition; corruption within, and the world and the Devil without, will withſtand ſuch motions. <hi>The fleſh will luſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt the Spirit:</hi> (yea, ſometimes with much violence) Yet the ſoul may find ſtrength and vigour, and a greater power carrying it out againſt ſuch contrary motions.</p>
               <p>3. Satans impulſes (how violent ſoever) are ineffectual; he urges to, but affords no help in the duty. A right <hi>Pharaob,</hi> exacts Brick, but gives no Straw: yea, therefore doth he exact it, becauſe he knows we have none; that he may find an occaſion, to beat, to trouble, accuſe, and torment Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48822:45"/>
So that the reſult of his impulſes are, either that the ſoul ſinks under diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives out, and falls under deſpair, of ever performing its Task<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe goes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on in a ſelf-tormenting diſconſolate manner; performs duty as a Task or drudgery, is ſpur'd on with horror, and comes off with<note place="margin">Ter. 20. 3.</note> greater horror; is a very <hi>Magor-miſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whereas the Spirits motions, are attended with enablements in ſome meaſure, it ſends the ſoul into Gods preſence, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree of enlargement, confidence, humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it commonly comes off, either with a gracious return; or elſe with ſome higher degrees of confidence and enlargement; at leaſt, more humble and ſenſible of its own deficiencies.</p>
               <p>This is what I thought fit, to give in anſwer to this Caſe: Yet, leſt any ſhould pervert, or make a ſiniſter uſe, of what hath been delivered; give me leave, before I paſs from it, to ſubjoin ſomething,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By way of Caution.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>By way of Caution,</hi> I ſhall give in two things.</p>
               <p>1. Let no prophane Spirit hence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſpeak blaſphemouſly againſt the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit in Gods people. Let none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48822:45"/>
hence conclude, that all pretended motions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gifts, aſſiſtance of the Spirit, are meer Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical impulſes and deluſions. Remember what is ſaid, and I hope evineed, in anſwer to the firſt Caſe. Nay, even hence, that they are Diabolical impulſes, and Satanical deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may conclude, that the Spirit of God is as powerful and induſtrious, in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up pious ſouls to good duties; as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is buſie, to ſtir up evil, or unſeaſonably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good motions.</p>
               <p>2. Nor let us think all motions unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and conſequently Diabolical, which find us under indiſpoſition, or are caſt in, when we are in our worldly imployments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The Spirit blows when and where it liſteth.</hi> Heavenly motions (and ejaculations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon) may be a whet in our ſecular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: it may be highly ſeaſonable, to have our hearts filled with Heaven, when our hands are full of the world. Spiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of earthly objects, is one of the great advantages of a Chriſtian, when the world is a ſtep, to help us up Heaven-ward. So, that you muſt take all together; judge not only, by the ſeeming unſeaſonableneſs, but by the violence and unreaſonableneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of thoſe motions; elſe you may run your ſelves into a ſad miſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Some may hence, take occaſion to ask, <hi>What courſe is to be taken, when the Devil thus unſeaſonably, and unreaſonably urges to duty?</hi> To anſwer in a few words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48822:46"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo to hearken to his unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motions, as to be taken off other duties; or, to throw our lawful imployments out of our hands; but yet make this advantage of them. Take the firſt convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and do that in its ſeaſon, which the Devil urges to be done out of its ſeaſon. Nay further, you may deſpite the Devil this way, by a reſolute performance of, and perſeverance in duty, when he is moſt buſie, to take you off: You ſhall find, that he is not more induſtrious, to put you upon a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unſeaſonably, than he will be to hinder and divert you, when God calls you to the performance of it. In a word therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch unſeaſonable motions, and time them aright. This will be, to turn the Temptation, into an advantage: and did we thus defeat that Adverſary, he would not ſo often trouble us in this kind.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> thing, which carries ſome reſemblance to the gracious Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, is the gift of prayer, which I have hinted at, in ſpeaking to the firſt Caſe. Briefly, it conſiſts in ability and aptneſs of expreſſion, with ſome ſhew of affection. It is a common gift: that is, Reprobates and carnal perſons may have it; and that in a greater meaſure ſometimes, than many a gracious ſoul; whereupon a wéak Believer may miſ-judge himſelf, and be diſcouraged, when he hears, with how much fluency and aptneſs of expreſſion, and with what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48822:46"/>
vehemency of affection, others can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty of prayer; and how low, flat, dull, and detective himſelf is. It will not therefore be loſt labour, to enquire how they they differ; that we may ſee, how far the grace is to be preferred before the gift; though the gift more ſets off a man in the eyes of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, the gift is but the outſide, the carkaſs of prayer; and when alone, without the grace of prayer, it ſatisfies it ſelf in words, and ſeeming affections, in that which may ſet it off before men. If there be but aptneſs and fulneſs of expreſſion, a voluble Tongue, with a ſemblance of zeal, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fervency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is all that the meer g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ft looks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence, <hi>as it is but the outſide of duty, ſo it looks much at an outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the applauſe of men:</hi> whence it follows, that it is intended or remitted, according to the encouragements it hath this way: where<note place="margin">Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</note> there is nothing of praiſe or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be expected, duty is omitted, or ſlubbered over, (which, I deny not, is too incident even to the beſt of Chriſtians:) But when there is probability of gaining ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or ſome external advantage; here the gift puts out it ſelf to the utmoſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The gift being but the outſide or carkaſs of duty, it is not much impaired by a courſe of ſin; eſpecially, if the ſin be cloſe and ſecret; the gift of prayer, and practice of ſin, can well enough conſiſt together:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48822:47"/>
yea, ſuch have been known, who could pray like Angels, and yet practiſed like Devils: who could make free, and full confeſſion of ſin, and yet as freely commit it.</p>
               <p>But now, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of prayer, is the inſide of the duty: It lies within, and mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in the vigorous motions of the ſoul, in ſanctified affections, holy reachings of ſoul after God, in vehement ſtruglings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings of the inward man, Pſal. 63. 8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee:</hi> and mainly in the exerciſe of praying graces, ſuch as Faith, Love, godly Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence it appears, that it may be exerciſed, when there is not a word uttered. The gift of prayer, lies much on the Tongues end, and may be hindered by man: but let the mouth be ſtopt, the tongue cut out, the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot be reſtrained, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4. Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could ſend up his ſoul to Heaven, in a ſecret ejaculation, when it is not probable he uttered any thing: and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s</hi> lips only moved: her voice was not heard, yet the voice of her ſoul, reached Gods ear. Exod. 14. 15. <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto me,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when we read not, that he ſpake at all. The tongue of the Spirit, cannot be cut out. And hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows two Conſequences, contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>1. The Spirit of prayer, is as much, or more exerciſed in ſecret, as in company. The ſoul hath moſt Elbow-room, when in the ſecret places of the Stairs; when there is<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. 14.</note>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48822:47"/>
none but God preſent, then can the ſoul, with a holy (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) boldneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, pour out it ſelf into Gods boſom: nor is it leſs careful, or circumſpect, when alone (unleſs under ſome Temptation) than if all the world were preſent.</p>
               <p>2. Conſcience of ſin, doth exceedingly weaken it, and cauſes a damp and deadneſs to ſeiſe upon it. Sin will reſtrain prayer before God. The Spirit of prayer will eat out ſin; or elſe ſin will weaken and ſhrink<note place="margin">Job. 15. 4.</note> it. Sin begets an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or ſhort-breathed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>2. The meer gift of prayer, doth ſwell and puff up: The more able, the more ſelf-conceited: in which reſpect, a man is apt to deſpiſe thoſe, that want the like gift, or fall ſhort of his meaſure; hath high and ſelf-applauding thoughts of himſelf, as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. or thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5. This is evident, when thoſe extraordinary gifts were beſtowed in the Primitive times, the Apoſtle ſaw it neceſſary, to caution thoſe that were endued with them, againſt oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Yet even in the exerciſe of theſe gifts, there may be much of ſeeming humility and ſelf-abaſement, in outward expreſſion, while the heart ſecretly admires it ſelf. Now, hence it follows, that when a man thus gifted, hath been outwardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, hath had liberty of words and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he comes off with much ſatiſfaction; if he have but ſo acted his part on the Stage, as to come off with publick applauſe, he is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48822:48"/>
well pleaſed: for he hath his reward (as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5.) though his heart (it may be) was full of diſtractions, pride, vanity: whereas on the other hand, if he hath been bound up as to expreſſion, and ſo miſs of his expected commendation, then he is creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen, then he is offended at himſelf, not ſo much, that he hath offended God, as that he hath not pleaſed men.</p>
               <p>But the Spirit of prayer is of a contrary nature: The more of that, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it layes a ſoul low, and fills it with the ſenſe of its own wants, weakneſſes and miſcarriages: Its work is to help the ſoul to abaſe it ſelf in the ſight of God. And hence it follows, that outward enlargements do not ſatisfie. Though a man hath ſpoken with the <hi>Tongue of Men and Angels,</hi> ſo as to have mens applauſe; yet he ſees ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deficiency, and corruption, as keeps him humble; yea, when others have thought him moſt enlarged, he ſees moſt cauſe to bewail his inward ſtraitneſs. Alas (thinks he) did you but know, how little teeling I had of what I uttered; what a diſtracted heart, what vain thoughts, what impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and extravagancies, were mixed with my prayers, you would ſee little cauſe to commend me: Nor (on the other ſide) is outward ſtraitneſs ſo grievous, if he hath ſound inward enlargements: for thus it is ſometimes, a ſoul may in ſome caſes take up that of the Poet,</p>
               <q>—<hi>inopem me copia ſeeit:</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48822:48"/>It may be loſt in the fulneſs of its own ſenſe; its affections may be too big for its expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; (which may be in part, the import of that in the Text, <hi>Groanings which cannot be uttered</hi>) like a narrow-mouth'd Bottle, which, though filled to the top, yet nothing will come our. Now, when a ſoul finds it ſelf thus, he can rejoyce, though others may miſ-judge, he rejoyces that he had a full Tyde of Faith, Love, holy Deſires, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Affections, though in reſpect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it was a very low Ebb. Theſe things are eſpecially experienced, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty with others.</p>
               <p>3. The meer gift, looks more at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, than the ſucceſs of the duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth it follow prayer, with faith or waiting; for it hath its end, <hi>viz.</hi> credit and applauſe from men. If a meerly gifted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath but prayed himſelf higher into the eſteem of men, his end is attained; he looks no further. Hence it is, that ſuch have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to thoſe things, which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their prayers, ſucceſsful and acceptable with God: he doth not conſider, where the ſtreſs lies; nor enquire whether he hath ſo prayed, that God may hear and anſwer; but rather, whether he hath ſo prayed, as to deſerve mens commendation. Two things there are, mainly conducing to the Efficacy of prayer.</p>
               <p>1. Intereſt in Chriſt, and Faith exerciſed on his interceſſion: Without this, prayer is abomination to the Lord. Now, meer gifts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48822:49"/>
do not eye Chriſt; ſueh think to be heard, for their gifts ſake (as the Heathens, for their much-ſpeaking) they think the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 7.</note> Arithmetick, Logick, or Muſick of their prayers, ſhall find acceptance; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do not much look at God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hear or not. I deny not, but ſuch may make as frequent mention of Chriſt, and may have his name as much in their mouths, as any; but there wants <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Purity of heart, is the other great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification: Jam. 4. 8, 9. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, purifie your hearts</hi>—then, <hi>Draw nigh to God</hi>—And 1 Tim. 2. 8. we muſt <hi>lift up pure hands, without wrath or doubting:</hi> For, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, If we <hi>regard iniquity in our heart, the Lord will not hear our prayers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 66. 18. See John 9. 31.</note> But now the meerly gifted perſon, hath little regard, to get, or keep his heart pure, any further, than as the vanity or impurity of his heart, may hinder the outward exerciſe of his gifts; he little confiders, what a holy God he draws nigh to, who cannot endure iniquity.</p>
               <p>Whereas, the Spirit of prayer, makes a man mainly ſolicitous about audience. Such as have it in exerciſe, would not willingly go away without their anſwer; and therefore labour, ſo to poſture themſelves, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch qualifications, as that they may ſpeed in their addreſſes to God: Eſpecially, they are ſolicitous about the two great <hi>Qualifications</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48822:49"/>1. That they both have, and improve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt: The Spirit of prayer doth as naturally lead the ſoul to Chriſt, as the Needle touch't with the Load-ſtone, turns North or South: It teacheth us the wiſdom of the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> to make Chriſt<note place="margin">Act. 12. 20.</note> our <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> our Interceſſor. And,</p>
               <p>2. It makes them careful, to approach the Majeſty of Heaven, with ſome degree of heart-purity: and this not only, while the duty is performed; but, before and after alſo: knowing, that an unholy heart, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to ſerve a holy God withal. In a word, the Spirit of Supplication, is alſo a Spirit of Sanctificatiou; and therefore helps the ſoul in ſome meaſure, to live as it prayes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the gift of prayer, may lodge in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure heart.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie, to add other differences: as this. The gift of prayer faints, and gives out, when it meets with oppoſition: but, the Spirit of prayer, gathers ſtrength, and encreaſeth its importunity. Again, the gift of prayer, is uſeful to others; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer, brings comfort and advantage to ones own ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I proceed to the third thing.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Third</hi> thing, which carries ſome reſemblance to the ſpirit of prayer; and therefore is to be diſtinguiſhed from it, is the urgings and preſſings of natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is undenyable, that Prayer and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of a Deity, is a piece of Natural Worſhip: I mean, atteſted by the light of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48822:50"/>
Nature. It is one of the more immediate concluſions, flowing from the conſideration of Gods Nature, of our Relation to him, and the neceſſity of ſupplies from him, that God is to be called upon. For, if God be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Good, the Fountain of all Good: and if we can have nothing, but by his leave; nor any thing that is good for us, without his love; In a word if our whole dependance be upon him, as to our Being, Suſtentation, Comfort and Happineſs (all which, right Reaſon will teach us;) Will it not undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow, that he is to be prayed to? Will not Nature teach us ſo much in point of Duty, ſince he is our Maker and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; and in point of Ingenuity, ſince he is our Benefactor? Now, even Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, having to the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the light of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and expreſs injunction of God, added; it cannot but ſometimes urge and preſs to the duty; and upon our pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable neglect, accuſe and trouble: How theſe urgings, may be diſtinguiſhed from the Spirits motions; is the Queſtion to be reſolved. Only, let it be premiſed (which I would alſo ſhould be underſtood concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gift of prayer) that where the ſpirit of prayer is, there may be alſo urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Conſcience; yea, the Spirit makes uſe of Conſcience, to put us upon duty. So that the ſenſe of the Queſtion, is, Whether it be <hi>mierly</hi> the urging of a natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or, whether the Spirit of God, by its gracious incitements, ſets conſcience on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48822:50"/>
work, to move us to this duty. And here,</p>
               <p>1. Natural Conſcience doth not ordinarily and conſtantly preſs us; but upon ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſion; whether, upon ſome powerful conviction wrought upon it by the Word; or the impreſſion of ſome awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Providence: as the Marriners in <hi>Jonah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jon. 1. 5.</note> being ſtartled by the Storm, fall to their prayers; Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> entreats <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 28.</note> for him, when terrified by Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, affrighted by<note place="margin">Acts 8. 24. Joh. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, deſires his prayers. Natural conſcience, rather drags us to God, as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judge; than drawes, or allures us to come to him, as a loving Father. Whereas the Spirit of God, though not alwayes alike, yet ordinarily, invites the ſoul into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and beſpeaks it, with words of love and ſweetneſs. And though I deny not, but it may ſet in with ſuch Convictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; yet, not <hi>then</hi> only: it makes uſe of Precepts, Promiſes, Mercies, and other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions (as was ſhewed before) to move us to this duty.</p>
               <p>2. Nor doth Natural Conſcience bring in aſſiſtance. It puts the ſoul on, but puts no ſtrength into it, whence, the duty is not ſpiritually performed; but ſlubbered and ſhuffled over: The water cannot riſe higher, than the fountain. The beſt <hi>that is born of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> A man may be vehemently urged, but when he ſets out, his leggs fail him: like ſome ſick perſon, that finds his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48822:51"/>
Appetite craving; yet, when he comes to it, can eat nothing; his Stomack turns againſt every thing, that is ſet before him. There is a great diſlike and diſreliſh of the duty within. Terror puts him on, corruption puls him back: little he can do; and indeed he cares to do but little: he hath no heart to the work, and therefore gets it out of hand as ſoon as he can: only, ſomething he muſt do; elſe he ſhall not feel <hi>quietneſs in his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 20. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>belly.</hi> But, the Spirit of God (as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) puts on to the duty, and ſets in with us. It not only, bids us, ſtand on our<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 2.</note> feet; but, enters into us, and ſets us on our feet, and then takes us by the hand, and teacheth us to go. So that the ſoul is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, and carried on, with ſome degree of cheerfulneſs; though not without many pull-backs, and much oppoſition: or, if it doth not make us chearful; yet, it makes us, in ſome meaſure careful. If the ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs its wants, it can vent it ſelf in groanings that cannot be uttered; if it be outwardly ſtraitned, yet, there is a kind of infiniteneſs in its deſires; the heart is for duty, and communion with God, though the hand can do little.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> though it preſſes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; yet, it is eaſily ſatisfied; a little thing ſtops its mouth: like the unfaithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 6.</note> it will take up with fifty, for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; it takes up with half-payments, ſlighty performances. So that ſomething be done (though never ſo poorly, and diſtractedly)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48822:51"/>
it is well ſatisfied. But where the Spirit of God is the Principle, it cauſes the ſoul, to hold on its motion, till ſomething be done, in, and by duty. It makes us, have reſpect to the manner, as well as the matter of our performances. Or, if duty be at any time ſhuffled over, it lets not the ſoul be at reſt; there is diſquietment within; and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of one duty, become matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and humiliation in its after-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
               <p>4. (What was ſaid of the <hi>gift of prayer,</hi> may be alſo ſaid here) <hi>Natural Conſcience</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regards the Iſſue of duty. Its end is not ſo much to be heard, as to be eaſed: the Convictions of duty, are its burden, which, when they are a little ſatisfied, it is at quiet, as having obtained its end. Whereas, the Spirit (as before) makes us ſolicitous to be heard, as it teaches the ſoul, to ask things neceſſary; ſo, it enables the ſoul to wait for an anſwer. And hence follows, on the one hand, mourning, humiliation, perſeverance, and greater importunity in prayer, if the mercy be not given in: And on the other ſide, if the Petition be granted; then, is the ſoul carried out in thankſgivings, and holy rejoycing; and (with the cleanſed <hi>Samaritan</hi>)<note place="margin">Luke 17. 15.</note> it returns, to give glory to God. Neither of which, are found in thoſe, who are acted meerly by the urgings of Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>4. There is yet a fourth thing, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Spirits motions and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48822:52"/>
                  <hi>viz. Good moods and fits</hi> in a meet natural man. Violent pangs of goodneſs, ſometimes ſeize upon a wicked man; and in theſe fits, he will pray, and it may be with much ſeeming ſervour and devotion, as I may allude to what is ſaid of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 22. 23. <hi>How gracious ſhalt thou be, when pangs come upon thee?</hi> Oh, how devout, how prayerful, how zealous, may he ſeem to be during the fit, and yet all vaniſh? That thus it may be, is fairly intimated, Job 27. 10. <hi>Will</hi> (the hypocrite) <hi>delight himſelf in the Almighty? Will he alwayes call upon God? q. d.</hi> He may indeed ſometimes pretend love to God; he may for a fit call upon him, but this will not continue: it is a fading co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.

Temporary faith may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce temporary prayer. Now, to give a clear diſtinction betwixt theſe, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motions, is a work of much difficulty? conſidering,</p>
               <p>1. That even thoſe, that have the Spirit of prayer, do often experience ſad abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and frequent withdrawments (as will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48822:52"/>
appear in the following Caſes) ſo that they are often at a loſs, and fear leſt theirs be no better, than ſome temporary pangs of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection.</p>
               <p>2 And then, how much of enlargement, and fervency, what ſeeming meltings, and breathings, a natural man may have at ſuch times, how much he may be tranſported above himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This conſidered, it muſt needs be, a caſe of much difficulty: here is a very ſmall thread to cut by; a very narrow Bridge to go over: and very dangerous it is,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 29.</note> leſt in pulling up the Tares, the Wheat alſo be pulled up (that I may only allude to that Parable) leſt I ſhould either ſlay the ſouls,<note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 19.</note> that ſhould not die, or ſave the ſouls alive, that ſhould not live: may that bleſſed Spirit (whoſe operations, I would clear from all miſtakes and miſconception) lead me into this, and every other Truth!

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48822:53"/>
and differ as much from the Spirits motions, as a fiery <hi>Meteor</hi> (which is nothing, but an oylie Fume or Vapour, drawn out of the Earth or Water, by the Sun's heat into the Air, and there ſet on fire) from a <hi>fixed Star.</hi> So that it is good to ſee, whether there be in us <hi>the root of the matter;</hi> whether the Spirit of Grace hath begun a work of grace upon our hearts.

Now, did you ever find, that Habitual praying-frame? That is, thoſe graces, which are to be exerciſed in prayer; ſuch as Faith, godly Sorrow, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, a holy Reverence of God, ſincere Love to Jeſus Chriſt? In a word, Is there a foundation laid in thy ſoul, of Repentance towards God, and Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Then, it may be hoped, that thoſe lively ſtirrings are the effects of the new Nature, the motions of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which hath taken up his dwelling in thy ſoul: But if thou art a ſtranger to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying converting work of Gods Spirit: If thoſe ſeeds of grace, were never caſt into thy ſoul; it is evident, that thoſe good moods, are nothing but Nature elevated by common grace, or tranſported, by ſome more than ordinary impreſſion from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,

it may be ſome unexpected mercy thrown in; as it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, <hi>Then believed they his words, they ſang his praiſe.</hi>

The worſt of men may have their devout moods: but alas! it is but from ſome outward impulſe. So that, Try what thy ſtate is; if thou art a ſtranger to the Spirits converting, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, ſanctifying work, it is not to be thought, he doth actually ſtir thee up to duty. The Spirit only moves to duty, thoſe whom he fits for duty. He is firſt a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life within, then of action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>2. But that which may more ſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48822:54"/>
thoſe fits of goodneſs, from the Spirits motions, are, the different fruits and conſequences. There may be as much ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fervour and zeal in thoſe good fits, while they continue, but they are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch fruits as the other. To inſtance in ſome.</p>
               <p>1. When theſe are over, the man is but what he was before: while the pang is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, Who more heavenly and devout? Who ſpeaks greater things of God and Chriſt, the ſweetneſs of duty, the advantage of holy walking, the pleaſures of communion with God? But alas! it is but as the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 4.</note> Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away.</p>
               <q>Quantum mutatus a illo?</q>
               <p>Here he is quite another man. Was he looſe, debauch't, prophane before? You'l find him<note place="margin">Stuppeae flamma. <hi>Cato.</hi>
                  </note> ſo ſtill. Was he drunken, riotous, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before? So is he again, as ſoon as the fit is over. Alas, it was but a meer blaze: It is quenched as Towe, as the fire of Thorns: and then he neither prayes, nor cares for prayer: or, if he keep up a form, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſcience, or affection. Now, where the Spirit hath furniſhed a ſoul with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abilities, it ſanctifies that ſoul: there is ſome care of a converſation anſwerable; and though there may be abatements, yet the ſoul ſeels, and complains thereof: whereas,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 5.</note> the other fits down contented in the neglect
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48822:54"/>
of duty. Where the Spirit puts in his hand, by the hole of the door, he leaves ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmelling Myrrh upon the handles of the Lock, which inflames the ſoul (though for ſome time it may lie under indiſpoſition) with enlarged deſires after his return. But there are no ſuch complaints under dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or breathings after quicknings, in the other.</p>
               <p>2. Theſe fits, are often encouragements to more looſneſs afterward. The ſoul being puffed up with a high conceit of his own performances; as having thereby mightily engaged God (an ordinary attendant on his flaſhy devotion) thinks he may take ſome liberty; he hath ſuper-crogated by his prayers, and now may ſin the more freely: much like the Harlots ſpeech; <hi>I have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 14, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>with me: This day have I payed my vows—Come let us take our fill of love—q. d.</hi> I have performed an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary piece of devotion, and now I am at liberty to begin a new ſcore. This is far from thoſe, who are endued with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer. Have they found extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtance? Hath the Spirit lift up their hearts, and wound them to a higher pitch than ordinary? This draws out thankſgivings to God. Thus they think; Oh, what need have I to watch againſt ſin? How carefull ſhould I be, left I damp out theſe flames, by earthly mindedneſs? leſt I take cold after ſuch heats? Yea, the remembrance of what they have been enabled to confeſs, and beg,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48822:55"/>
becomes a tie upon them, to reſtrain them from committing the ſins confeſſed, and a ſpur to put them upon purſuit of the graces they have begged: theſe are the genuine fruits of the Spirits enlargements. I deny not, but the Devil, and our own corruption, may make uſe of theſe, as a Temptation to ſlacken our diligence afterwards: but it is not ordinarily ſo. Thoſe fits and flaſhes, ordinarily bring forth ſuch fruits.</p>
               <p>3. (Which I toucht upon in the laſt) theſe good fits puff up. Man is naturally a ſelf-admirer, and if he hath any thing above ordinary, he prides himſelf in it. The moſt civilized, and moralized, amongſt the Heathens (though they ſometimes ſpake meanly of themſelves) could never get vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over that ſelf-applauding humour. It ſticks very cloſe to nature; nothing but grace can ſubdue it: nor that perfectly, till we be made perfect. For each to eſteem others, better than themſelves, is the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing in the world (<hi>Si quid in tota vitâ difficile, hoc in primis; Nam, Regis intra ſe quiſque animum habet, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Galvin</hi> upon <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3.) But to the purpoſe; Such as have only Nature elevated come off more proud, whatever ſhew of humility they may make in the duty: Whereas the genuine effects of the Spirits aſſiſtance (as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) are, to lay the ſoul low in its own eyes; and indeed there is not a better evidence, that our enlargements are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, then when we are enlarged in the ſenſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48822:55"/>
of ſin and miſery, and thence become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in our apprehenſions of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe good fits are eaſily put off. How ſmall a Temptation, will hire ſuch from duty? How eaſily are they diſcouraged? How ſoon is their patience ſpent? God muſt either come ſpeedily, or they will be ready to ſay with that blaſphemer, <hi>This evil is of</hi>

                  <hi>him, and about his houſe?—But, put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and be will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ſo hot, as their paſſion will be high, when God croſſes their wills. I ſay, thus it is ſometimes with ſuch. But now, where the Spirit enables, the ſoul gathers ſtrength by oppoſition; follows a flying God; diſappointments ſet an edge upon his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>call</hi> his patience into exerciſe: He will cloſe in with God, though he go halting away. His reſoultion is, <hi>Though he kill me,</hi>

again, and renews, encreaſes his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Thus I have laid down ſomething, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the good fits of Nature, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, from the grace of the Spirit of Prayer.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48822:57"/>2. Or, when he wants the actual quickning motions and aſſiſtances of the Spirit: though he hath a ſaving work begun, and his life be whole in him; yet he is in a ſpiritual Swoon, hath no warmth, no motions or ſtirrings heaven-ward, little differs from a meer carnal perſon. That it may be thus for a time, the ſad experience of ſome of Gods precious ſervants will teſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, is Gods gracious vouchſaftment, and meer indulgence. God is not a debtor to any: If he withhold it, none can charge him of injury or injuſtice: and, if he vouchſafe it, none can ſay, they have obliged God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The Spirit is a free Agent, and <hi>blows where it liſteth.</hi> It is Gods Spirit, and<note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> not ours; and he may ſay to us, as in Matth. 20. 15: <hi>May I not do what I will, with mine own?</hi> The Influences of the Spirit, are like the Influences of Heaven: Who can blame God juſtly, if it do not rain or ſhine, when he would have it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Prayer is a duty indiſpenſably ariſing, from our Relation to God, as we are his creatures, endued with reaſonable ſouls, having our whole dependance upon him: So that our Obligation to the duty is laſting, and ceaſes not, while we are in the body, compaſſed about with infirmities, neceſſities, temptations; in reſpect whereof, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtand in need of Gods help: We are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48822:57"/>
taught every day to ſay, <hi>Give us this day our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>daily bread</hi>—Whether therefore we have, or have not the Spirits aſſiſtance, the duty is duty ſtill; the neceſſity of it, and obligation to it, is permanent, not variable according to the vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or witholdings of the Spirit; and therefore it is ſinful, to neglect the duty, upon pretence, that we have not the Spirits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablements.</p>
               <p>This I hope, might ſatisfie any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Judgement; but, becauſe I would make things as Practical as I can, I ſhall add ſomething further, to evince the Abſurdity of their Opinion, that make our Obligation to the duty void, where the Spirit helps not. But of this briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. This aſſertion as ſtrongly fights againſt all other duties, as this of Prayer: for, without the Spirits Aſſiſtance, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform any duty pleaſing to God. And indeed thus far, have ſome already improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: Hence, they will neither read, nor hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when the Spirit moves them. So, that this conceit (however it may carry ſome ſhew of Reaſon in it) ſeems to be a piece of the Devils Sophiſtry, deviſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the practice of Religion: an Invention much like the Phariſees <hi>Corban;</hi> whereby<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 5.</note> they diſobliged Children from their duty to Parents. Nay, what a door would it open to all wickedneſs, licentiouſneſs, atheiſtical and vile practices; and then all muſt be charged
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48822:58"/>
on God, becauſe he gave them not his Spirit to reſtrain, and ſanctifie them? Can any thing be more blaſphemous, or more tend to the ſubverſion of Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That which is a puniſhment of ſin, cannot be an excuſe for the neglect of duty: now the withdrawing or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ſpirit's aſſiſtance is often a juſt puniſhment for ſin, for our grieving, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quenching the Spirit, &amp;c. When we improve not it's offered help, reject it's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or arrogate to our ſelves what we ſhould aſcribe to it's gracious enablements, or the like; how juſtly may God withhold it? This ſeems to be <hi>David</hi>'s caſe, when he had fallen ſo grievouſly; it is probable, he found a want of the quickning comforting influences of Gods Spirit: and therefore prayes—<hi>Take not thy Holy Spirit from me: q. d.</hi> I feel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 11, 12.</note> and withdrawings, Oh, do not wholly deprive me of its Indwelling. Again, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me with thy free Spirit: He felt weakneſſes and faintings, and therefore prayes to be upheld—But now, did <hi>David</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to pray? Nay, doth he not pray more importunately? Were that opinion right, then a man might by ſome horrid provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grieve away the Spirit of God, and then he ſhould be diſobliged from duty, than which, what can be more abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48822:58"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. But to put all out of queſtion, The Precepts concerning this duty enjoyn conſtancy in it: and the patterns of the Saints agree to thoſe Precepts, 1 Theſſ. 5. 17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> Eph. 6. 18. <hi>Praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Let none cavillingly object, That we are bid here to <hi>pray alwayes, but yet in the Spirit:</hi> for (beſides that it is doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit of God be meant here) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not hence, that we muſt never pray but when moved by the Spirit. We ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed alwayes to beg the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, but if God in juſtice withhold his Spirit, muſt we therefore neglect our duty? But more of this, by and by. Daily prayer is enjoyned us in that pattern, which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour hath preſcribed us, and ſo much was typified by the Morning and Evening Sacrifice. As for the Practice of the Saints, Pſal. 55. 17. <hi>Evening and Morning, and at Noon will I pray, and cry aloud</hi>—Dan. 6. 10. Daniel <hi>kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</hi> Note, that it was his conſtant practiſe. It were caſie to add more here, but this may ſuffice to convince thoſe that are not wilfully blinded. I would only add that this Opinion would deſtroy all ſtated publique prayer, ſince we cannot tye up the Spirit to our times, yet there are frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48822:59"/>
for it in the Word, Let that one Text ſuffice, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Will any yet urge the Text in hand and tell me, that without the Spirits help we know not what to ask, and therefore our prayers will be but vain bablings, or taking Gods name in vain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer.</hi> 1. True indeed, we cannot pray as we ought without the help of Gods Spirit, but I urge, Is the Obligation deſtroyed, when aſſiſtance is denyed? No, this ſhews us the ſad condition of every carnal and unregenerate perſon, and all ſuch as have not the Spirit, what a ſad Dilemma they are in; If they pray not, they ſin, by neglecting a manifeſt duty; if they pray, they ſin, by an ill management of it: This ſhould make us haſten out of that doleful ſtate, and I would add here, that there is (<hi>aliquid tertium</hi>) a third way: I ſay not, that we are abſolutely bound to pray without the Spirit, nor yet to neglect the duty becauſe we have not the Spirit, but we are ſpeedily to go to Chriſt, and accept him on Goſpel Terms that the Spirit may be poured out upon us from on high, that we may have the <hi>ſpirit of grace and ſupplication</hi> given us.</p>
               <p>2. I may further anſwer, that though God ſometimes vouchſafe his Spirit to ſtir up his people to prayer, yet this is not to be preſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or conſtantly expected or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. Its help is not alwayes Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the duty, but comes in upon our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48822:59"/>
Our work is to do what we can, in hope that God will by his Spirit enable us to do what of our ſelvs we cannot. He that ſits down reſolving to do nothing till the Spirit put him on, doth Tempt the Lord, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably expect what God hath no where abſolutely promiſed. I would therefore ſay to the Chriſtian that complains of deadneſs and indiſpoſition as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon, Ariſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 22. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee.</hi> It may be obſerved, how low and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>David</hi> is in the beginning of ſome Pſalms, and yet how full of Faith and Confidence in the cloſe: May we not rationally think, that the Spirit of God raiſed him up, and came in upon him, while we was meditating or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I ſhall but lay this one thing before thoſe, that oppoſe this Truth. Do you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to plow, or ſow, till God bid you: till he come and tell you, He will bleſs your labours, and ſend rain and ſeaſonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, do you forbear Food or Phyſick, till God give you aſſurance, that he will bleſs the creatures, and make them nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and healthful? No, but you plow and ſow, eat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expecting Gods bleſſing, <hi>He that ploweth, ploweth in hope</hi>—<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 10.</note> And ſhould we not do the like in ſpirituals? not ſtay till we have a particular command, or impulſe of the Spirit, but take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to read, hear, pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in expectation both of Gods aſſiſtance in, and his bleſſing upon our endeavours.</p>

               <p>A Fourth Caſe concerning the help of the Spirit in prayer may be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 4. What is on our part to be done, that we may enjoy this great Priviledge, that our prayers may not be the meer expreſſions of our lips, or workings of our own hearts, but the breathings of Gods Spirit? A Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which deſerves our ſerious thoughts, though I ſhall diſpatch it in a few words; leaving many things to your own meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enlargement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We can do nothing to merit or engage the Spirit of God, to attend us in our prayers. You have already heard, that the Spirit is a free Agent; not working by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or neceſſity; nor can all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours oblige him to us. Far be it from us, to imagine, that we have any of that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, or congruous Merit the Papiſts dream of, whereby we may deſerve the graces of the Spirit. All grace is the free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved gift of God: we may put that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to thoſe that have the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace; <hi>Who maketh thee to differ</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>from another? and what haſt thou, that thou
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48822:60"/>
didſt not receive? (i. e.</hi> freely, undeſervedly) <hi>Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it? i. e.</hi> Why doſt thou boaſt, as if it were purchaſed by thy own endeavours or deſervings?</p>
               <p>2. Yet ſomething may be done in order to our receiving, or being capable of the gifts and aſſiſtances of the Spirit: that is, in the doing whereof, God may graciouſly beſtow his Spirit; not, becauſe we deſerve it; but, becauſe he hath graciouſly promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it, and hath made that the condition upon which he will give his Spirit.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt and great condition is, That we accept Jeſus Chriſt, according to the tender of the Goſpel: The Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> of Children: <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> Obſerve here, He is called the Spirit of his Son; not only, becauſe the father hath not given his Spirit<note place="margin">John 3. 34. &amp; 14. 16.</note> by meaſure (that is, above meaſure) unto him; but, becauſe he procures the ſending of the Spirit, with all the gifts and graces of it. It will not here be neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into that intricate Labyrinth, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit, as to ſome of its graces and operations, be not received into the ſoul, before its actual cloſe with Chriſt (the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative whereof, as to the order of Nature ſeems to me unqueſtionable) But as to the Caſe in hand, it is ſufficient to know, that the Spirit of Supplication, is only their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48822:61"/>
who are Sons; and Sons none can be, but by regeneration, and implantation into Chriſt: <hi>To as many as received him, to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>gave he power</hi> (right or priviledge) <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to be, or to be made) the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Would you then be endued with a Spirit of prayer, that you may come to God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and confidence, that you may be enabled to pray, with groanings not to be uttered, that the Spirit may make Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in and for you, according to the will of God? Here then is the way, come to Chriſt, caſt off all ſelf-righteouſneſs, accept of his merits and ſatisfaction: Take his yoke upon you: put it out of queſtion, that Chriſt is yours, by making your ſelves his, giving up your ſelves to him wholly, abſolutely, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly. None can have the Spirit making Interceſſion in their hearts, but thoſe that accept of Chriſt, and have him their Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in Heaven.</p>

               <p>3. In the deep ſenſe of our own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and inſufficiency, beg the Spirit to help and enable, to teach you how, and what to pray. It is amongſt the good things which God hath promiſed to beſtow upon thoſe that ask it: Compare Matth. 7. 11. There it is <hi>good things</hi> in general, with Luke 11. 13. There it is <hi>the Spirit,</hi> as being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently a good thing, or comprehenſively and virtually, the ſumm of thoſe good things which God beſtows upon his children. This is promiſed for asking only. Labour to be ſenſible of your own neceſſity. To which end, do but conſider, what a pure, holy, heart-ſearching God you are to draw nigh to, what qualifications are required in thoſe that worſhip him; and particularly, what graces are requiſite to the ſpiritual and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable performance of this duty.

muſt be attended with a humbling ſight of ſin, and hearty ſorrow for it; your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a deep ſenſe of your wants, and enlarged deſire and expectation of ſupply; to all which, muſt be added, Charity and Compaſſion towards others. Theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other graces and qualifications are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the acceptable performance of this great duty. Now ſit down, and conſider your own ſtrength: Are you able to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own legs? Can you either beſtow theſe graces upon your ſelves, or put them in exerciſe? Were prayer nothing but word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with God, the Spirits help were leſe needful; but if this be indeed to pray, Oh what need have you and I, to beg down the Spirit of God into our hearts, to enable us hereunto?</p>
               <p>4. Meditation alſo, is another means, whereby we may be fitted for the Spirits operation; it is a door by which it enters into the ſoul; it prepares the Sacrifice, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, fire from Heaven often comes down. <hi>My heart was hot within me; while I</hi>

methodical way; the ſoul is oyl'd by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then the Spirit ſets it in motion. If you ask, What Meditations will prepare us for the Spirits in-comes; There is a large field to expatiate in, the works and Word of God, the Precepts, Promiſes, examples of the Saints, the encouraging experiences of Gods people, the prevalency and perpetuity of Chriſts Interceſſion: and eſpecially, your own wants, infirmities, temptations, theſe will be ſpurs to put you on; and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Spirit will not be wanting to fill your ſayles.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48822:63"/>This is what I ſhall give in by way of Counſel in this caſe: but poſſibly, ſome may have this ſecret Objection in their hearts againſt all that I have ſaid:</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>You preſcribe ſuch things, in order to the attainment of the Spirit, which preſuppoſe the Spirits being already in the ſoul: Who can accept Chriſt, or purge his heart, or pray aright for the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but thoſe that already have it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer briefly: It is granted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that without the Spirit enabling, theſe things cannot be done: Yet, neither are ſuch directions, nor our endeavours vain; If ſo, then all the Counſels and Exhortations of the Word, all Precepts, Means, Motives, would be vain upon the ſame account. I am far from aſſerting the Power of Nature in ſupernatural actions, or that Popiſh merit of congruity (conſiſting, as they tell us, in thoſe preparatory diſpoſitions acquired by our own endeavours, by which grace is merited) But I may, I think ſafely, aſſert theſe two things;</p>
               <p>1. That man is not a meer ſtone, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a reaſonable ſoul; that is, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> to conceive of things propounded, and <hi>Will,</hi> to chooſe the good, and refuſe the evil, though both ſadly corrupted by the <hi>fall,</hi> the one with blindneſs, error and prejudice; the other, with obſtinacy, contrariety and enmity to the Will of God; Both ſtrongly carried out

                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>evil good, and good evil; putting bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</hi> Now theſe two Faculties, namely, the <hi>Intellective</hi> and <hi>Elective</hi> Faculty remaining as to their ſubſtance, though corrupted, as to their qualities; it follows, that man is ſtill capable of Reproofs, Counſels, Exhortations, Directions, and other rational means, tending to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good. I have not been ſpeaking theſe things to Stones and Stocks, that cannot hear what I ſay; nor yet to Brutes that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand; but to reaſonable creatures, endued with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> to conceive of things ſpoken: and <hi>Wills,</hi> to chooſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, though ſo fettered with corruption, that of themſelves they cannot come up to the performance, of what I have propoſed: I would add this further; Though nature cannot come up to theſe things, by its own ſtrength; yet, there are many things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of a natural men, which are in a tendency towards them. May not ſuch read the Word, and conſider the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and advantage of having a ſaving Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt? May they not repreſs many vile and ſinful thoughts, and do ſomething to the mortifying of ſin; at leaſt, as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of it? May they not attend the Word in publick, remember and meditate upon it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that to lay down ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, Exhortations, Counſels, is not to beat the air; or, as it is in the Proverb, <hi>(ſurdo canere) to ſing to a deaf man.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48822:64"/>2. (Which I hope may ſatisfie) Theſe Counſels and Exhortations are, as I may call them, the [<hi>vehicula Spiritûs</hi>] in and by them the Spirit works, and enables us (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unable) to do that, to which we are exhorted: The Word of the Lord comes to<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and bids him <hi>ſtand upon his feet;</hi> and therewithal the Spirit enters into him, and ſets him upon his feet. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> preached to the Women that reſorted to them, and the Lord opened <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart to attend unto the things that were ſpoken. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>The Apoſtles went forth and</hi>

                  <hi>preached every where, the Lord working with them</hi>—which was the fulfilling of that great promiſe made to them, and all faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>Lo, I am with you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The ſumm therefore of what I have ſaid, amounts to this; that, though you cannot without the Spirit, come up to what I have directed; yet you are to put out your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, and in ſo doing, God may pleaſe to accompany theſe Directions with his holy Spirit, enabling you to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what you cannot do in your own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall look on this, as a Digreſſion; yet I hope, it will not be thought either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impertinent or unneceſſary. And, let ſuch know, that my main deſign in it, was to waſh off the filth, that ſome have caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Doctrine, and to clear it from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that is unjuſtly charged upon it; as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48822:65"/>
if, by denying mans freedom of will, and power in ſupernatural things, we made all the Exhortations and Counſels of the Word void and uſeleſs: For, <hi>To what purpoſe (ſay they) or with what conſiſtency with your own Doctrine, can you perſwade and exhort men to accept of Chriſt, to believe, repent, &amp;c. when almoſt with the ſame breath you tell them, they have no power to believe, repent? &amp;c. This is to tye a mans hands and feet, and then bid him, run or work.</hi> Now, my Brethren, that which I have laid down, fully anſwers this Cavil. For, ſay I, man can by the power of nature, go ſome ſteps towards theſe things, (the external acts of Religion, hearing, reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the internal). And then further, I have a Promiſe, that the Spirit ſhall go along with my Exhortations, and ſhall work that in their hearts, which I can but ſpeak to their ears. And now judge, I beſeech you, which of us come nearer the Truth. They perſwade men to Faith and Obedience, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, that they have Freedom of Will to do theſe things: We perſwade, and exhort men, in hope and expectation, that the Lord will co-operate with our Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and work that in their hearts, which we can but ſpeak to their ears, or preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by Moral Swaſive Arguments. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the corrupted and depraved will of man, or the All-powerful, heart-changing grace of God, the ſurer foundation to build upon? Much more, I could add: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn whence I have digreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48822:65"/>By this that hath been ſaid, it appears, that what I have laid down in anſwer to this Caſe, is not in vain, even to thoſe, that yet are void of the Spirit. Something they may and ought to do, in order to theſe things: And (if I may without offence, uſe the words of our Saviour) The things I have delivered, <hi>are not mine, but his that ſent me:</hi>

And<note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 17.</note> now, may the Lord, who teacheth to profit, and who hath his Spirit, to ſend, when, and to whom he pleaſeth, follow theſe Counſels with his Spirit, that they may be effectual to their intended end. Mean while (becauſe this Caſe is in the nature of an Exhortation to get the Spirit of Prayer) it will not be amiſs, to preſs my ſelf, and you that hear me, to the uſe of theſe helps, for the attainment of this great Priviledge, by two or three moving Conſiderations: wherein I ſhall not ſay what I could, but what is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. Let the firſt Motive be drawn from the miſery of thoſe, that want the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer: which (had I the Tongue of Men and Angels) I could not fully expreſs. It was the Speech of a good man, that <hi>One is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dod.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>never to purpoſe miſerable, till he be in affliction and cannot pray.</hi> But it is not only in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſuch are miſerable: Let a man be in a condition never ſo proſperous, the want of this is unſpeakably ſad. It were eaſie to deſcend into particulars, but I forbear. In
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48822:66"/>
ſhort, Would you not think it a ſad caſe, to be dumb, or tongue-ty'd, or to have your tongue cut out, that you could not make known your wants or ailments? Will you not much pity and compaſſionate ſuch? But what's that, to the want of a Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? That's but outward, this Spiritual: that may be many wayes ſupplyed, as by ſigns, or writing (as <hi>Zechariah, Luke</hi> 1. 62, 63.) But this can be no wayes ſupplyed, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated. The very want of that, draws out mens bowels; you will ſooner and more bountifully relieve ſuch, than a clamorous Beggar. Their want of Speech, is the moſt moving Rhetorick. But, God is deaf to thoſe that are ſpiritually dumb; his ear is ſtopt to them, whoſe mouths are not opened. He bids, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 10.</note> Again, is it not unſpeakably ſad, to be under an unſupportable burden, ready to be cruſh't in pieces, and not able to cry out for help, though it is at hand, if we could but call for it? This is thy Caſe; Guilt lies upon thy ſoul, a Load that will ſink thee into the loweſt Hell: Mercy is at hand to help, to eaſe thee, if thou couldſt but cry for it. But without a Spirit of prayer, either thou canſt not cry, or not ſo, as that God will hear thee. Beſides, we will ſuppoſe thee in a Wilderneſs of Troubles, ready to ſink <hi>in the</hi>

                  </hi> if thou couldſt <hi>pour out thy complaint to him,</hi> and ſhew before him all thy trouble? Oh, but how intolerably heavy is thy burden like to be, when the whole weight lies upon thy own back? This is the ſpecial advantage, of have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of prayer; which the Apoſtle hints at in the Text: It <hi>lifts with us,</hi> it gives vent (and conſequently <hi>eaſe</hi>) to a ſoul rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be overwhelmed. Once more, wer't thou ready to be devoured, and torn in pieces by Wild Beaſts, Wolves, or Lions, and mightſt be reſcued, upon thy calling for help; How ſad were it, to want a tongue, in ſuch an Exigency? Poor ſoul, thou art ready to be ſeized upon by the <hi>roaring Lion,</hi>

If thou canſt not pray, with <hi>Daniel,</hi> this Lyon will have the maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 24.</note> of thee, and break all thy bones in pieces, and make thee the miſerable ſubject of his eternal Torments. But this is little to what might be ſpoken: Thy wants are infinite and very preſſing, yet thou haſt no way to fetch in ſupply. Thy burdens great (and the greater, becauſe not felt) and no way to fetch in ſupport: Thy dangers and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many (and the more, becauſe not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48822:67"/>
feared or apprehended) yet no where to hide thy ſelf: Divine Juſtice and Vengeance rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſeize upon thee, to take thee by the Throat, and not a Tongue to cry for mercy. Death ready to arreſt thee, and the Devil to hurry thee into an eternal Priſon, where is nothing but weeping, and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth, yet canſt not ſpeak a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word in Gods ear, though thy life, thy ſoul, thy eternal happineſs lie upon it. Oh, who would not tremble, and haſten out of ſuch a condition? And while I have ſaid all this, I would be underſtood thus, that the Spirit of prayer, is a remedy againſt all theſe miſeries. So that there is a ſecond Motive included in this: <hi>viz.</hi> The unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having that Spirit of Adoption; that may teach us, <hi>to cry Abba Father.</hi>

Join with others, alas! they he like Stones; no rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or chaſing, will beget any warmth in<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 15.</note> them: In their own ſenſe, much like <hi>Saul;</hi> God anſwers them, neither in one way, nor another. Then how dejected and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late! Oh, what would they give, for the leaſt degree of thoſe enlargements, and meltings they have formerly experienc't; That they could but give vent to their ſorrows, in hearty ſighs and groans! That they could but pour out their ſouls, with that child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confidence, as ſometimes they have done! Now therefore, its worth our ſerious enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what may be done on our part, to have the Spirits company and aſſiſtance for, under ſuch Ebbings and withdrawmen's, a child of God cannot but conclude, it is his own fault, ſome grievous miſcarriage, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of that ſweet Gueſt.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore, I ſhall premiſe this, that as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48822:69"/>
the beſtowing, ſo the continuance of the Spirits motions, and lively operations, is the meer indulgence of Heaven. God can be no more bound to continue it, than he was to beſtow it. Think not then, to oblige God, by any thing you can do.</p>
               <p>2. And further, I premiſe, That, the Lord vouchſafes, or with-holds his Spirit, as he ſees beſt for his people. It were not beſt for a child of God, to have alwayes a full Tyde, to live under the conſtant ſmiles of Heaven, and to have continual raptures &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements. Where would be room for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, as it is the <hi>ſubſtance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>

How muſt we know, where, and what we are, how weak, how inſufficient, to think a good thought? How muſt we be kept from pride, and ſwellings, and puffings above meaſure, if we be not ſometimes left to our own weakneſſes? So that, it is not for us to be peremptory, or abſolutely to deſire alwayes ſuch degrees of grace, ſuch meaſures of aſſiſtance and enlargment: we may humbly deſire, and endeavour in the uſe of means; but we muſt not be peremptory for them, nor impatient under the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of them. In this caſe, we muſt learn of our bleſſed Saviour: <hi>O my Father,</hi>

Or thus, Take heed you grieve him not: if ſo, you will have the worſt of it; he will grieve you by withdrawing his aſſuring Teſtimony from you, and leaving you in the dark, as to your eternal ſtate. This, I humbly conceive, to be genuine, and according to the mind of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48822:70"/>
the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in that Scripture. So, that you ſee our grievings of the Spirit cauſes his withdrawments as to aſſurance: and ſo it doth likewiſe as to aſſiſtance. If you fall aſleep in the lap of ſowe <hi>Dalilah</hi>-luſt, you will find your Lock will be out, God will depart from you; and then you will be weak as others. It would be infinite to ſpeak, what might be ſaid under this Head, I ſhall only inſtance in two or three Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Beware of <hi>Pride in enlargements:</hi> If God lift you up, in vouchſafing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enlargements, take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you do not lift up your ſelves; that is the next way to be laid low: He that begins to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomething, ſhall quickly find, that he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing in himſelf: This is to abuſe your mercy: Gods and is, that you might give him glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not take it to your ſelves: and it would be to your own prejudice, if it ſhould be continued: for, thus abuſed, it becomes fuel for Pride and Luſt: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not ſo befriend our corruptions.

Let it be your care to bear a low Sail, when you have the moſt proſperous and ſucceſsful gales of ſpiritual enablements. <hi>A prick in the fleſh,</hi> ſhall cure Spiritual Tumours.</p>
               <p>2. Take need alſo of <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency;</hi> I mean, a conceit, that you need no more. Whatever gifts or enablements God vouchſafes, think not, you can live upon this ſtock, without continual ſupplyes: What you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48822:70"/>
can neither be improved, nor long continue, without more additions: God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, nor will, put any Chriſtian into a ſtate of Independency: Never did any Saint in this world arrive at that perfection, as to be able to live within, and of themſelves: your ſtrength is in Chriſt, and continuance of ſupplies and communications from him;<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 10. 2 Tim. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Lords, we will come no more unto thee?</hi> God takes it ill, when we begin to think, we need not be beholden to him; and indeed its the higheſt degree of pride, we can poſſibly be guilty of: 'tis intolerable inſolency, and God will lay us as low, as we lift up our ſelves high: the Spirit will make us know our inſufficiency, when we begin to conceit in our ſelves an al-ſufficiency.</p>
               <p>3. Cheriſh no corruption in our hearts. Sin entertained (as we have once and again told you) will drive out the Spirit. When this Serpent grows warm in the boſome, it will hiſs, and diſquiet the Holy Spirit; the ſteam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of concupiſcence, are exceedingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſive to it. It is impoſſible to keep up a Spirit of prayer, and a courſe of ſin. He that will not be led by the Spirit, ſhall not long be helpt by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>4. And eſpecially take heed of cheriſhing lazineſs and ſluggiſhneſs. Be not found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Bed of caſe, when the Spirit calls you

out to work: at leaſt, be not loath to riſe, when he knocks.

When it is too late, ſhe riſes to open; but her Beloved had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone. Now ſhe would fain enjoy him, if ſhe might; but now ſhe ſeeks, and cannot find him; ſhe calls; but he gives no anſwer. Now, ſhe that might have had him for riſing and opening, muſt be at much pains, and run through many hazards, get many a blow and wound, be ſtript of her vail, and yet not find him; here's the fruit of lazineſs. If the Proverb hold true any where (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is moſt true) then here eſpecially, (<hi>ex otio negotium</hi>) of Idleneſs comes buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note place="margin">

               <p>2. Let the Spirits motions find ready en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and hearty entertainment. It is an encouragement to give a friend more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits, that gives us hearty welcome: Say to the Spirit, as <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

Improve theſe ſeaſons as an evidence of this great Truth; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirits help in prayer, is no melancholy dream, as the prophane world imagine; but a great reality: What ſtronger or more pregnant demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can you have of it, than your own ſenſe and experience? Hereby you may fortifie your ſelves againſt the ſcoffs of ungodly men, and pity thoſe that ſpeak evil of things they know not.

               <p>Again, Theſe aſſiſtances may beſtead thee in a dark day, when thou art under the hidings of Gods face, in a ſtate of Deſertion, and wanteſt the ſenſible preſence and lively workings of Gods Spirit: Then may theſe experiences be a heart-cheering Cordial:

Then maiſt thou call to remembrance thy Songs in the night; thy prayers, thy holy breathings and enlargements, and the very remembrance, may prove reviving to thy ſoul; and by ſuch Muſings the fire may kindle again, which ſeems almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht.</p>
               <p>3. Improve the Spirits aſſiſtances, as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and inducement, to be more frequent and conſtant in this duty, and againſt the pull-backs and diſcouragements from it, which at any time thou meereſt withall: Thus beſpeak thy ſoul: <hi>Why ſo dull and beartleſs? Why ſo backward to a duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou haſt found, and maiſt ſtill hope to find ſo mighty a Helper? True indeed, it is a duty of much difficulty, and utterly above my own ability, but why ſhould I be diſcouraged? I can do all things through the Spirit ſtrengthning me. How ſoon can the Spirit turn this barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of my heart, into a ſtanding water; and this dry ground, into water-ſprings? How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be breathe upon me, and cauſe theſe dry bones to live? Why ſhould my own Impotency diſcourage me, when I may expect the help of Omnipotency? What though I can do nothing in my own ſtrength? cannot the Spirit of Grace, make his ſtrength perfect in my weakneſs, and enable me from a like experience to ſay (with the Apoſtle) when I am weak, then I am ſtrong?</hi> Remember that our bleſſed Saviour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to procure the ſending of a <hi>Comforter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14. 16.</note>

its lively aſſiſtances, yet you may be aſſured it is in you (ſince you have experimentally known its power and influences) and this may encourage you to ſet upon duty, even when under the greateſt indiſpoſitions and diſcouragements, in hope that when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to lift, this powerful Helper will <hi>lift with you.</hi> It is much to depend upon another, we do (in a ſort) engage them to do for us, when we tell them, we will truſt to them. So, if under wants, weakneſſes, indiſpoſitions, diſcouragements, we would yet go upon our work, depending on the Spirit, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enablemants, it would be a ſingular means to engage his aſſiſtance. And here, let me adviſe the complaining ſelf-diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Chriſtian, Thou that complaineſt of thy deadneſs, diſtractedneſs, inability, and that thou wanteſt the Spirits help as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Take this word of counſel, and make tryal of it. Turn thy ſad complaints into humble confidence; reſolve with thy ſelf, not to be diſcouraged from duty: Say thus, Well, I am unable to do any thing, I know not what to ask, nor how to pray; but I will go notwithſtanding, and the weaker I am in my ſelf, the more confidently will I expect the aſſiſtance of that Spirit, whoſe work it is to help our infirmities, and to make interceſſion for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered: I am aſſured he can, and I ſhall humbly hope he will, quicken my deadneſs, enlarge my ſtraitneſs, and make up all my wants from his abundance. Thus to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48822:74"/>
improve your experienced aſſiſtances would be the beſt way, to have them continued to you; for hereby you give the Spirit of God much glory.</p>
               <p>4. And forget not to improve them into thankfulneſs. Let not God loſe his glory, and thou ſhalt not want the comfort. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Spirits aſſiſtance, as well in bleſſing God for what thou haſt, as in begging what thou wanteſt: and amongſt other mercies, forget not to be thankfull for this mercy it ſelf, as being one of the choiceſt: Say as <hi>David, Who am I Lord</hi>—that I ſhould<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14.</note> be able to ſerve thee with ſuch alacrity, to pray (though alas, with much infirmity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtractions, yet) with ſuch a meaſure of faith, fervency, importunity? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Spirit enables that <hi>thy ſervant hath</hi>

                  <hi>found in his heart to pray this prayer before thee.</hi> Oh when thou feeleſt at any time the warming, enlarging influences of the Spirit of Supplication, riſe not off thy knees, till thou haſt made thy thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements to him, who hath drawn out and held up thy heart in duty.

                  </gap>) freedom, <hi>liberty of ſpeech,</hi> and confidence to be heard in our Petitions: Now this cannot be without the Spirits aſſiſting and encouraging: So that it amounts to thus much. If ye abide in me, ye ſhall have a Spirit of Prayer, liberty, and confidence in asking, and the grant of your Petitions. Therefore I ſay, abide in Chriſt:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48822:77"/>
and in ſo ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would be underſtood to mean theſe things.</p>
               <p>1. Abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt; I mean the great Doctrine of Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt alone. Take heed of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Linfie-woolſy Merit; Mix not the Woollen of mens ſuppoſed ſuper-erogatory Merits, with the clean white Linnen of the Saints: The Spirit will no longer be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor in our hearts, than we rely upon Chriſt alone as our Interceſſor in Heaven. I am confident the Spirit never went along with prayers, put up in the name of the virgin <hi>Mary, Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> Abide then in this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>2. Abide in the Faith of Chriſt: I mean a perſonal applicatory Faith, whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Chriſt and his merits, for acceptance of our perſons, and audience of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is not enough, that we aſſent to the Doctrine, but we muſt alſo rely on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We can no longer pray in the Spirit, than we pray in Faith; If we ſtagger in our affiance, we ſhall want our wonted aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>3. Abide alſo in the love of Chriſt: maintain a ſingular and ſuperlative eſteem of him in your hearts; count him the chief of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, altogether lovely. To abide in Chriſt, is to continue and <hi>abide in his love.</hi> But<note place="margin">John 15. 9, 10.</note> what is this to the purpoſe in hand? How will this procure the Spirits continued aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in prayer? Very much: Love to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48822:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt is one of thoſe ſweet and fragrant flowers (indeed of his own planting) wherein the Spirit is much delighted. Obſerve that Text, <hi>If a man love me, be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>will keep my words. and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> How elſe do the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son make their abode in a ſoul, but by the Spirit? Where, then, the Love of Chriſt is, there the Spirit takes up his abode; and where he abides, he cannot be idle and unimployed. He is like ſome friend, that though they come but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting, will further, and not hinder buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: though indeed his coming to the<note place="margin">John 14. 16.</note> ſoul, is not to give us a viſit, but to <hi>abide with us for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo much in anſwer to this fifth Caſe.</p>

               <p>IN the two laſt Caſes, I have propoſed ſomething, 1. In order the Attainment of the Spirit of prayer: 2. In order to the Preſerving and continuing it. The next will be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 6. What may I do to recover the Spirits help and enablements, its quickning motions, its lively ſtirrings and aſſiſtances, when they are withdrawn?</p>
               <p>I need not ſay much of the uſefulneſs or neceſſity of this Caſe: What I ſpoke of the former, is eaſily applicable hither. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent complaints of Gods people concerning their indiſpoſition, coldneſs, ſtraitneſs and inability to prayer, ſufficiently tell us, that it is needful to propoſe what may be thought effectual in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>Something is fit to be premiſed, though in effect it hath been hinted before.</p>
               <p>1. We may be ſaid to loſe or want the Spirits aſſiſtance: either,</p>
               <p>1. As to that degree of livelineſs and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which we have formerly found. There may be abatements of that fervour, enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vigour of affections that we have exerciſed in prayer. This is the common
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48822:78"/>
experience, I believe, of all Chriſtians; They do not alwayes enjoy the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of divine enablement; ſometimes they ſail ſwiftly, Wind and Tide favour them; at other times their motion is very ſlow, they drive heavily, much ado to bear up againſt the Wind and Waves.</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes we may ſeem wholly to want the Spirits aſſiſtance; not one good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no heart to pray. I ſay not, that we may loſe the Spirit, as to its Indwelling; but as to its operations, there may ſeem a Ceſſation of any lively breathings: As in a Swoon, the breath may be ſtopt, the pulſe not beat ſenſibly, ſo that one may not feel himſelf alive, and may be judged by others to be dead; Though (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>)<note place="margin">Act. 20. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>his life is in him.</hi> Now I would be underſtood to ſpeak to both theſe. What is to be ſpoken, may reſpect both the remiſſion and abatement of degrees, and alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion or ceſſation of acts of Spiritual life. Both ſorts need Counſell.</p>
               <p>2. The Spirits Return muſt be an act of free grace; and indeed, of rich grace. For I ſuppoſe, it will be granted, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit withdraws not, but upon ſome great Provocation: though God may have (as you have heard) very gracious ends in ſuch deſertions; yet, I can ſcarce think he doth it, till we have juſtly deſerved it, and in a manner, driven a way his holy Spirit. Now you may eaſily ſee, that to ſin againſt the Spirit of God, after we have enjoyed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48822:79"/>
found the ſweetneſs of his aſſiſtance, and known the advantage thereof; muſt needs be a very provoking ſin; it carries in it much of ingratitude and diſ-ingenuity. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſin was the more hainous, becauſe<note place="margin">1 Kings 11. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>his heart was turned away from the Lord his God, who appeared unto him twice.</hi> How ill then, muſt God needs take it, that thou ſhouldſt grieve his Spirit, and abuſe his goodneſs, who hath appeared ſo often, ſo ſweetly and comfortably to thy ſoul? Who hath helped thee at many a dead lift, and put many a good motion into thy heart, and held thee up in duty? So that thy ſin is not a little ſin; it calls for a deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; it may coſt thee many a deep ſigh, many a briniſh tear, before thou recover thy former ſtate. Nay, poſſibly God may ſet juſt cauſe, never to return to thee in that degree of enlargement, and thoſe gracious manifeſtations, which thou haſt ſinned away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou maiſt lay down thy head in ſorrow, though thy eternal condition be ſecured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This I ſay, not to break any bones, or to diſcourage any from uſing means; but to let them know, that its dangerous to grieve the Spirit of God: and that it requires the utmoſt of their diligence and induſtry, to recover from under ſuch deſertions. And now I come to lay down ſomething in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Thy firſt work muſt be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out the ſin or ſins, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48822:79"/>
have robbed thee of this Priviledge. Search and ſearch again, till thou findeſt out the <hi>Achan,</hi> that hath thus <hi>troubled thy ſoul.</hi> Here I cannot reckon up every particular ſin, that may poſſibly be a cauſe of the Spirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment; but only hint, what probably may be, and ordinarily is the occaſion of it. It is not every miſcarriage, that grieves away the Spirit; then who ſhould enjoy that Priviledge? <hi>The Spirit helps our infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> It pitties us under weakneſſes: therefore meer failings do not provoke God, to take away his Spirit. Nor yet every greater ſin, if ſpeedily repented of. You can ſcarce ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a ſin more hainous for the nature, than <hi>Peter's:</hi> or more aggravated by its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Yet it appears not, that he lay under deſertion; <hi>he wept bitterly:</hi> and it is not likely, his tears were prayerleſs: and no ſooner is our Saviour ariſen, but he muſt have the Tidings with the firſt. Such things intimate, that he fell not under deſertion. His repentance was as ſpeedy and ſerious, as his ſin was hainous. Well, what ſins then then do moſt probably cauſe the Spirits withdrawment? I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. Sins that carry much of the will in them, preſumptuous ſins, when light is held priſoner, and captivated by luſt.</p>
               <p>2. Or ſins long lien in; when we wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (as the Swine) in the mire of ſin. It is ſuppoſed, <hi>David</hi> lay ſome Moneths in the ſin of Murder and Adultery, before he repented: and he intimates (as you have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48822:80"/>
heard) that he wanted the joy of Gods ſalvation; he felt decayes, and fears tho ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Gods Spirit.</p>

                  </gap> 3. Sins more directly againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits guiding or aſſiſting; when we will not take its directions, hearken to its counſels; or when we abuſe its grace and aſſiſtances. See then, whether thou haſt not cauſe, to charge ſuch kind of ſins upon thy ſelf: Haſt thou not ſhut thine eyes, againſt ſome beam of ſpiritual light? Haſt thou not known the will of thy heavenly Father (as to ſome ſin which thou oughteſt to abandon, or duty which thou oughteſt to ſet upon) and yet neglected to do it? If ſuch ſins be upon thee, thou maiſt probably conclude, they are thoſe that have grieved the Spirit. Again, Is there not ſome ſin, that hath been thy old acquaintance, that thou haſt lien and lived in a long time? what ſin or ſins are they, that (like <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors) have been brought up with thee? Thoſe alſo may have robbed thee of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits gracious aſſiſtance: But eſpecially, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> if thou haſt not refuſed the Spirit as a guide: when it called thee to duty, haſt thou not neglected, put it off, ſlubber'd it over? When it hath diſſwaded thee from ſome ſin, or perſwaded to ſome duty, Haſt thou not pulled away the ſhoulder? Haſt thou not withſtood its motions? Been like green Wood, that didſt not take fire by thoſe heavenly ſparks? So for its aſſiſtances, haſt thou not quenched, diſcouraged, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48822:80"/>
them. When he hath called to open, <hi>and put in his fingers by the hole of the door,</hi> thou haſt ſeigned excuſes; Worldly concernments have called thee another way. Or, may be, when he hath breathed upon thee, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee above thy ſelf in any duty, thou haſt grown proud, ſecure; and applauded thy ſelf, inſtead of aſcribing glory to God. See if ſome, or many of theſe, or the like, be not found in thee. Nor reſt in a general diſcovery (for its eaſie to ſay in general, that ſuch ſins are ours) but labour to be as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and diſtinct as poſſibly thou canſt. Recollect times and places, when thou haſt been eſpecially guilty. Remember what good motions thou haſt had and rejected: Such a time, God by his Spirit gave me a lively Touch; Oh, I felt the Babe ſpring within; but how did I ſmother it! Such a time I came off proud of my enlargement: Such a time, I had clear diſcoveries, powerfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, ſtrong impulſes, but gave them cold entertainment; diſmiſt them with fair promiſes, and ineffectual purpoſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe, O! theſe, are grievous to the holy Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Humble thy ſelf before the Lord; confeſs and give glory to God, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the puniſhment of thine iniquity;</hi> and<note place="margin">Lev. 26. 42.</note> this with all ſeriouſneſs, with real grief, ſhame, and ſelf-abhorrency: aggravate thy ſin before the Lord; acknowledge how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious he hath been, in vouchſafing thee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48822:81"/>
ſuch experiences, and how ingrateful thou haſt been in ſlighting and abuſing them. Shall I put words into thy mouth (but O that they may not be meer words! Oh that they may be the very ſenſe of thy ſoul, and breathings of thy heart!) Let theſe therefore be the workings of thy ſoul: <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and juſt are thy judgements; What can be more highly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rule of Juſtice, than that</hi> from<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 12.</note> him that hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What could I expect leſs, than what thou haſt inflicted? for, Should the Majeſty of Heaven alwayes put up ſuch abuſes? Should I think to grieve the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit of God from day to day, and yet have his company and aſſiſtance as before? No Lord, thou art righteous, but I am wicked; and ſhouldſt thou for ever hide thy face, ſhouldſt thou leave me under a prayerleſs, ſenſleſs frame,

Alas! how many thouſands are in thoſe flames, that never ſinned at that rate that I have! They knew not, and did not, and therefore deſerve a few ſtripes; but I have known thy will; nay, thy gracious Spirit hath ſtirred me up to do it; yea, hath offered his help in the doing of it; yet I have refuſed and ſlighted his offers, and therefore deſerve many ſtripes.

It is ordinarily ſome ſtubborn reſiſtance, or affront of the Spirit, that drives him away; at leaſt, ſome palpable neglect of yielding obedience to his motion: therefore a yielding plyable frame, is the next way to a recovery.

THere is yet one Caſe more, to which I deſire to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>viz.</hi> Whether ſet and ſtated Forms of Prayer, are Impediments to the Motions and Aſſiſtances of the Spirit? By Forms, I mean a tying up ones ſelf, or being tyed up by others, to words and expreſſions, not to vary from them, but conſtantly to uſe the very ſame, without variation. Not only to have ſome Modell, Method, or naked Heads in our minds, which we may enlarge upon more or leſs; or to which we may add, or alter, as our occaſions and neceſſities require, but to utter the very ſame Words and Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables conſtantly in our addreſſes to God by prayer.</p>
               <p>Now here I meet with ſome on the one hand, who utterly decry all uſe of forms, as unlawful, or highly inconvenient, as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Chriſtian, and reſtraining the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Prayer, by neglecting to make uſe of thoſe gifts and helps, which the Spirit or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily beſtows upon Chriſtians: yea, they think it next an impoſſibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to perform the duty, with any affection or acceptance in that way.</p>
               <p>Others on the other hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I would add this, as to the lawfulneſs of a form, God hath made prayer our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtant duty; but, he hath no where forbidden us, to uſe the ſame words, or enjoyned us to uſe no other, but our own extemporary conceptions: Except therefore the Diſſenters will ſay, that to uſe a form, is to deſtroy the very Eſſence of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (which will ſcarce be proved) they muſt grant a form lawful and warrantable.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I ſay, it may be uſeful, and in ſome caſes neceſſary. I will ſay little more to this, than what is ſaid by a Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is not to be ſuſpected of too<note place="margin">

               <p>1. Some even amongſt Chriſtians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, are ſo rude and ignorant (though it may be ſpoken to their ſhame) that they cannot tolerably expreſs their deſires in prayer, Muſt ſuch utterly neglect the duty? Is it not better, during their groſs ignorance,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48822:86"/>
to uſe the help of others gifts and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than not to pray at all? or to utter that which is ſenſleſs and impious? I ſpeak it not, to excuſe their ignorance, or that that they ſhould be encouraged, to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied herein, but for the preſent neceſſity.</p>
               <p>2. Some again, though they can do it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and ſo far as my ſuffice in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret addreſſes to God; yet when they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pray before others, want either dexterity and fitneſs of expreſſion, readineſs of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, or confidence to uſe thoſe abilities they have (whom yet I will not excuſe from a ſinful baſhfulneſs) and for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though it is partly a gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet it may be in a great meaſure acquired and improved by reading, meditation, and exerciſe.</p>
               <p>3. It is poſſible, that ſome bodily diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or ſodain diſtraction, may befall ſuch as are otherwiſe able, which may beclowd their minds, weaken their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This may happen in caſe of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, cold Palſies, or the like diſtempers. I may add (what the fore-cited Author notes) that it is profitable for ſome to have their deſires and meditations regulated by ſuch helps; for all, that have expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot ſo methodize their thoughts in praying with others, as to avoid diſorder and confuſion.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, that in the Caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48822:87"/>
or the like, a form may be profitable and helpful. Nor is it a tying up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but, if conſcionably uſed, may be both attended with the Spirits aſſiſtance, and find acceptance with God.</p>

Yet it will not hence follow, that any ſhould ſatisfie themſelves in ſuch ſtated and ſtinted forms: much leſs, that thoſe who have praying abilities, ſhould be enforced by others to reſt in them. If ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, baſhfulneſs, defect of memory, of other diſtemper, may render it excuſable and neceſſary to ſome, is it fit, all ſhould reſt in their meaſure? Where then will be, that coveting earneſtly the beſt gifts? or why<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. ult.</note> ſhould thoſe who are excellently gifted that way, be hindered from the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that gift, becauſe others want it?<note place="margin">

I think I may lay down this, as an undoubted Truth, that by the uſe of thoſe helps which God hath afforded us, not only Miniſters, but moſt ordinary Chriſtians (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſe of ſome extraordinary defect of memory, or diſtemper of mind or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) may attain to a competent meaſure of ability this way: Let but Chriſtians ſtudy the Word, and their own hearts together, labour to acquaint themſelves with their own ſins, wants, temptations, afflictions,

               <p>I ſpeak nothing but what may be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Inſtances of many able prayerful Chriſtians, whoſe gifts this way, may put thoſe to the bluſh, that carry the name of Miniſters of the Goſpel, and yet not only fall ſhort of them, but do not ſo much as endeavour the attainment of that gift. Well, ſuch gifts are ordinarily attainable, and therefore we ſhould labour after them: and this I ſhall (I think with good reaſon) affirm, That in caſe we have ſuch abilities, or may in the uſe of means attain them, but yet through lazineſs, or in complyance with the times, or mens humours, will not labour after them; or having them, will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48822:88"/>
not improve them; here, to accuſtom our ſelves to a conſtant Road or Track of words and expreſſions, without variation, muſt needs be a reſtraint upon the Spirit. I ſhall here again take the liberty, to ſpeak in the words of the Author, who hath given us<note place="margin">Ameſius ubi ſupra.</note> three or four ſolid Reaſons, why ſuch forms are not to be reſted in.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe a preſcribed form, ſince it doth not follow, but lead our affections, doth that leſs perfectly, which is of the nature of prayer. He means, if I rightly underſtand him, that whereas prayer mainly conſiſts in the expatiating of the affections and reachings of the ſoul after God; words being but the overflowings, as it were, of the heart, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſecret prayer) it muſt needs be, that our affections muſt be tyed up within the compaſs of our expreſſions, and cannot ſo freely expatiate, have not ſo large a field to walk in; ſo that a form in this cafe, is much like a weight which Huntſmen hang upon their ſwifteſt Dogs, to make them keep even with their fellows: To him that hath abilities, it is a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> and makes the Affections follow, which ſhould lead in that duty.</p>
               <p>2. In a preſcribed form we cannot ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expreſs our deſires and wants to God. He that knows any thing of his own condition, knows, that he is ſubject to daily changes, which it is impoſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſtated form ſhould reach. New corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations to be prayed againſt,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48822:88"/>
new ſins to be confeſſed, wants to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Changes of condition, and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Providence, call for ſuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, petitions, thankſgivings, beſides the concernments of Church, Nation, Family, neighbourhood, particular Chriſtians, to which a ſtinted form cannot be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is true, there may be ſuch general Heads couch't in a form, as may glance at all theſe; but theſe cold generals cannot ſo affect us, as we ought to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> affected. God knows before we ask, and better than we can tell him, what our ſins and wants are (and indeed if it were the end of prayer, only to inform God, we might ſpare our labour). But he would have us feel our own ſins and wants, and to be affected with the condition of his Church and people; in which reſpect, our prayers ſhould deſcend into particulars: for as he ſaith, <hi>ſpecialia pungunt,</hi> particulars impreſs moſt, and do moſt deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect us.</p>
               <p>3. The Spirit of God is wont in prayer, to excite ſpecial affections in our hearts, which are often hindered, by our conſtant ſticking in a form, there can be no further excitations, than the matter of the prayer is apt to beget, whereas in conceived prayer, the Spirit of God hath (as I may ſay) more room and liberty to work upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our hearts; to caſt in ſuitable promiſes, which we may plead with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Under a preſcribed form, oſcitancy and ſluggiſhneſs is more apt to ſeize upon us.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48822:89"/>
I ſay not, that it muſt neceſſarily be ſo; but I fear, it is the too ordinary experience of thoſe that uſe a conſtant form. It is too true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that formality may, and doth creep—into our duties, when performed in the moſt ſpiritual manner: how often, alas, is the gift of prayer exerciſed, where praying graces are not? Yet ſurely, in a conceived prayer, there is ſomething more to call out the ſoul to attention, while we are cloathing the ſenſe of our hearts in fit expreſſions; and as it were, digging the matter of our prayers, out of our own feelings and experiences, it muſt needs keep the heart cloſer at work.</p>
               <p>5. I add, that as to others that joyn, a prayer accommodated to the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church or Nation, to the preſent ſtate of the Place, Town, City, or People, muſt needs ſtir up more kindly aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A word (and ſo a prayer) in ſeaſon, how good is it? <hi>A word fitly ſpoken</hi> (upon the wheels) <hi>is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi> For inſtance; we will ſuppoſe a poor creature ſtrugling with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, lying under that inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a wounded Spirit: How ſweet is it to ſuch a ſoul (if the Lord pleaſe to go along with it) to have his condition ſpread before the Lord? to have his very fears, complaints, doubts, troubles expreſſed in his own language? to have a faithful Miniſter,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48822:89"/>
or prayerful Chriſtian beſpeak God for him, as if himſelf was in the very ſame condition, to urge and plead ſuitable promiſes, and wreſtle with the Lord on his behalf? Muſt not this needs more affect the poor wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul, than a dull form, that comes not near his condition. I will in ſhort give you<note place="margin">

                  </note> a relation to this purpoſe: <hi>It was the cuſtom of Reverend Mr.</hi> Perkins, <hi>to go to the place of Execution, with the condemned Priſoners: Once a young luſty fellow going up the Ladder, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an extraordinary lumpiſhneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Spirit; Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>obſerving it, ſaid to him, What man? What is the matter with thee? Art thou afraid of Death? Ah no, ſaid the Priſoner (ſhaking his head) but of a worſe thing. Whereupon Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>bid him come down, and ſee what Gods grace would do, to ſtrengthen him: who coming down, Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>took him by the hand, and made him kneel down with himſelf at the Ladder foot. Where that bleſſed man of God, made ſuch an effectual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in confeſſion of ſins, and aggravating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in all circumſtances, with the puniſhments due to the ſame; as made the poor Priſoner burſt out into abundance of tears. Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>perceiving, that he had brought him low enough, even to Hell Gates; proceeded in the next place, to ſhew him the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſtretching forth his bleſſed hand of mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and power to ſave him—which he did ſo ſweetly preſs upon the ſoul of the Priſoner, as cheered him up again, to look<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beyond Death; and made him break out into new ſhowers of tears, for joy of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48822:90"/>
the inward conſolation, which he had found; and gave ſuch expreſſion of it to the beholders, as made them lift up their hands, and praiſe God, to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſuch a bleſſed change in him; and ſo took his Death patiently and joyfully.</hi> See here the effect of a prayer in ſeaſon; though I would neither rob God of his glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe bleſſing, no ſuch effect could have been wrought; nor attribute it to prayer, as being conceived, and extemporary; but I think I may, under God, aſcribe ſomething to the ſuitableneſs of it, to that poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preſent condition; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I muſt needs prefer it to ſuch, as being framed in ſuch general expreſſions, as may reach any condition, cannot be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to a particular time, perſon, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In ſhort then, a conceived prayer hath theſe advantages above a form.</p>
               <p>1. It leaves the ſoul more freedom, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert preſent affections; and makes more room for the Spirit, to excite graces in the ſoul, ſuitable to all occaſions and emergencies.</p>
               <p>2. It affords more opportunity to put up ſuitable petitions, to the many and various Wants, Temptations, Providences, and other emergencies, reſpecting our ſelves, or thoſe we pray with and for; which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be attended with more kindly ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of affection, and exerciſe of grace, than under cold generals.</p>
               <p>3. It more calls out, and imployes the ſoul; makes it more attentive to what it is about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how neceſſary it is, to uſe the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48822:90"/>
beſt means, to keep the heart to its work in duty, there is not an experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but can tell, from the ſad experience he hath of his own wanderings and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies.</p>
               <p>4. And (which I look upon, as not the leaſt excellency of it) it is ſingularly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for edification. By the mutual partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of each others gifts exerciſed in this kind, Chriſtians build up one another: they not only help to excite preſent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and graces, but they furniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with matter, and arguments in prayer; So that by this means, the body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> every jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 12.</note> excell in this gift, excell to the edifying of the Church.</p>
               <p>5. It helps a man better to diſcern the preſent frame of his own heart. The beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pulſe, is not a better Tryal of the Temperature of the Body, than prayer is of the frame of the ſoul. Something, it is true, one may diſcern, even under a form; but it is much better diſcerned, when <hi>out of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 34</note> 
                  <hi>abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi> How may a poor ſoul ſometimes diſcern its want of faith, love, deſire after God, delight in God, want of godly ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compaſſion, and fellow-feeling of his Brethrens miſeries, by his coldneſs and ſtraitneſs in prayer,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48822:91"/>
when at ſometimes, he can ſcarce utter a word with any feeling; at other times he hath plenty of expreſſions, but no ſtirrings of affection? Again, at another time, how ſenſibly are theſe graces exerciſed in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? How can he ſtir up himſelf, to lay hold on God? Confeſs ſin with a bleeding heart; begg and plead, and purſue God with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How tenderly can he repreſent before the Lord, the affliction and condition of others? and put his ſoul in their ſouls ſtead? So that he may judge very much of the preſent ſtate, by his ſtraitneſs or enlargement in this duty: yea, he can better diſcern, when he hath the Spirit helping his infirmities, and when he is under a deſertion.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the Advantages of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer, above ſtated forms. And now in a few words, to apply what I have ſaid to the Caſe in hand.</p>
               <p>To which, that I may give a clearer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; be pleaſed to diſtinguiſh with me,</p>
               <p>1 Betwixt the Abſolute Power of Gods<note place="margin">Perk. Amoſ.</note> Spirit, whereby he being God, can do all things he pleaſeth: and his Ordinate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby he worketh according to that ordinary way, and connexion of cauſes, which God hath decree'd and appointed. You may thus conceive; By Gods Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, he could rain down Manna from Heaven, to feed the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Wilderneſs; but when they came into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> that ceaſes; and he feeds them in the Ordinary way, by plowing, ſowing, reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48822:91"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to that Series of Cauſes; <hi>I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 21. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyle, and they ſhall hear</hi> Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel. Now, according to this diſtinction, I ſay that the Spirits Abſolute Power is not reſtrained by ſtinted forms. He can make the dulleſt form effectual, to excite and quicken the ſoul; no matter what the Tool be, if Omnipotency put forth it ſelf, the work ſhall be effected. But in the Spirits ordinary way of working, which is, (as you have heard) a rational argumentative way, wherein he maketh uſe of means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural vertue and efficacy; So a form cannot have that effect upon the ſoul, as a conceived prayer, uttered by ſuch as are competently qualified with that gift; partly, becauſe the cuſtomarineſs of it dulls the ſouls attention: chiefly, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo accommodated to the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the ſoul, and to ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, times, and Providences; by which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the matter of prayer, the Spirit of God uſually ſtirs up more lively and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections.</p>
               <p>2. Thus diſtinguiſh: The Spirit may be ſaid to be hindered: either,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In totum,</hi> wholly, ſo as not to afford any aſſiſtance: or,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In tantum,</hi> as to the degrees of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when it doth not work ſo vigorouſly and kindly upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p>I will not deny, but that the Spirit of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48822:92"/>
God may concurr with a form, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably uſed, and attended: but there is that in the Nature of a Form, that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as to thoſe lively and vigorous motions and affections it, might ſtir up in the ſoul, or (as I have already ſaid) a form doth, as it were, confine the Spirit of God within its own compaſs, and leaves him leſs room to exert his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>3. Diſtinguiſh alſo (as hath been hinted before) of the cauſes, why a form is uſed, and the perſons that uſe it.</p>
               <p>1. Some may uſe it of neceſſity, becauſe they want abilities; and muſt either pray ſo, or not at all. In this caſe a form may be a help; and if conſcionably attended, the Spirit of God may go along with it. This (ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>) is no binding of the Holy Ghoſt; but a helping of the Spirit, which is weak in us, by a Crutch to lean upon.</p>
               <p>2. Others uſe it, through lazineſs, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt the uſe of gifts, baſhfulneſs, or the like cauſe, when they might attain abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, if they would uſe means. In this caſe I cannot excuſe ſuch, from a neglect of ſtirring up the gifts that are in them, and of uſing that means, whereby the Spirit might put out his power more freely and vigorouſly.</p>
               <p>4. Diſtinguiſh of the manner of mens uſing both forms, and preſent abilities. Some may uſe a form humbly, conſcionably, and in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48822:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſincerity: Others may uſe gifts in pride, oſtentation, and hypocriſie. Here the Spirit of God, may rather be expected to go along with the former, than the latter: for <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>humble.</hi> But this is not the fault of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but of the perſon. Where gifts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in humility and ſincerity, they are to be preferred before the beſt of forms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grounds above-mentioned. I cannot therefore but conclude, That he that having both natural abilities, and helps at hand, (as moſt Chriſtians have in our days) to attain the gift of prayer, yet ſitsdown in form; muſt needs do himſelf much injury; doth both put fetters upon his own Spirit, and limits the holy Spirit of God within the compaſs of that form; and in a word, deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, of thoſe and the like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages above mentioned, which might accrew by the exerciſe of his gifts: yea, if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Maſter of a Family, or one who is the mouth of others in prayer, he becomes in a great meaſure guilty of that deadneſs, careleſneſs and inſenſibleneſs, which others contract under his formality. So that though I would, that thoſe who have no better abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or helps to attain them, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe a form, than neglect the duty (and in that caſe, I doubt not, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, would afford his quicknings and aſſiſtances in the conſcientious uſe thereof); Yet let none, through idleneſs, baſhfulneſs, or a conceit, that it is only for Miniſters,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48822:93"/>
or men of Parts and Learning; or that it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Enthuſiaſm, or on any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, neglect to get that gift, that you may be competently able to repreſent your own, your families, the Churches, or Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to God, in your own words: Say not, it is unattainable: there are, through mercy, many poor Chriſtians, who have neither the advantage of Learning nor Education, that may ſhame ſome Miniſters in the exerciſe of this gift: and though I acknowledge, that after all endeavours, there will be a great difference amongſt Chriſtians; yet, we ſhould not therefore hide our own Talent in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, leſt we at laſt fall under the cenſure of<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 26.</note> wicked and ſlothful ſervants.</p>
               <p>This is that, which I conceive to be the Truth. I would not diſcourage the weak conſcientious Chriſtian, from the uſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary helps; nor would I encourage any, to ſatisfie themſelves in ſtinted forms: but labour to encreaſe in knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that they may be able to go without thoſe Crutches.</p>
               <p>And now it may be, ſome would deſire to be directed, what means they ſhould uſe, for the attainment of this gift, how they may get above a form?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That much is already done by others: as <hi>Brinſley, Wilkins, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, &amp;c.</hi> who have laid down many profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table helps this way; into which Treaſury, I have alſo endeavoured to caſt my Mite, in the Treatiſe hereunto annexed, being a familiar

But above all, earneſtly (as thou canſt) beg of God a ſerious gracious heart, without which, couldſt thou pray with the tongue of men and Angels, it would profit thee nothing.

               <p>THE Second Doctrine, from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſideration of the words remains to be ſpoken to; which was this,</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>The Spirits help in prayer, is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Priviledge and Comfort to Gods Children in affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of the Doctrine is clear. The ſcope of the Apoſtle, is to comfort Believers under preſſing afflictions. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down other grounds of comfort, he brings in this with a connexive Particle (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>likewiſe alſo: q. d.</hi> add this alſo as a ſpecial ground of comfort, that the Spirit it ſelf helpeth—</p>
               <p>The Doctrine for the more diſtinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, falls into two Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>1. That God vouchſafes the Spirit of prayer to his afflicted children.</p>
               <p>2. That it is a ſingular comfort to enjoy it. I ſhall touch upon each ſeverally, and then apply them together.</p>
               <p>To the firſt; Saints under trouble, have the Spirits help in prayer. When a load of afflictions is on their backs, God ſends his Spirit into their hearts, teaching them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48822:97"/>
to cry <hi>Abba Father;</hi> then eſpecially, though not only.</p>
               <p>I would be underſtood thus:</p>
               <p>1. Not alwayes in a full meaſure, with enlargements of affection and expreſſions: ſometimes they can only chatter, and figh out their ſouls grievances: yet even theſe ſilent mournings, are loud cryes in Gods ears.</p>
               <p>2. Except this be their trouble, that they are under deſertion and withdrawments of the Spirit, which God ſometimes ſees expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to exerciſe his people withal; yet even then, there is (as you have heard) a ſecret aſſiſtance, which makes a ſoul, though he thinks himſelf <hi>caſt out of Gods ſight;</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve<note place="margin">Jon. 2. 4. Job 13. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to look</hi> again <hi>towards his holy Temple,</hi> and <hi>though the Lord kill him, yet</hi> (with <hi>Job) to truſt in him.</hi> But in other troubles, and for the moſt part, the Spirit is then moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in the heart of a Believer, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are moſt preſſing.</p>
               <p>For confirmation, I ſhall only lay down this: That the Saints in their troubles have ordinarily prayed more, and more fervently and importunately, they have then doubled their diligence, and plyed the Throne of Grace with reſtleſs cries, have given God no reſt. This will eaſily appear in a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſome of the moſt faithful ſervants of God. <hi>Jacob</hi> is a famous inſtance: when he hears of his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi>'s approach with<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>four hundred men</hi> at his heels, he is (not without cauſe) <hi>greatly afraid and diſtreſſed;</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:48822:97"/>
and ſee how ſweetly, and with what ſinewy arguments he beſpeaks God: there, he goes through many Topicks of Invention, claims Relation to, and Intereſt in God, upon the account of a Covenant ſtruck betwixt God<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 9.</note> and his Anceſtors; <hi>O God of my Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>—Then faſtens on that Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> (the Lord) which imports Gods eternity and immutability: Next pleads a twofold word of God: 1. Of Command, <hi>Thou ſaidſt unto me, Return unto thy Counttey—q. d.</hi> I am now performing an act of obedience, and therefore expect protection; I am doing thy Commandment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect thy ſalvation. 2.

               <p>2. (Which follows upon the former) It brings caſe with it; it may well be called hearts caſe. Experience tells us, if we have but a faithful friend, to whom we may impart our grievances, and freely unboſome our ſelves; it

This hath been the Saints practice; <hi>David</hi> ſtill had recourſe to God by prayer; and you may in many Pſalms obſerve, how the caſe is changed, and his ſoul refreſhed before his prayer be ended; he got renewed ſtrength: <hi>In the day when I cryed, thou anſweredſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 3. Pſal. 55. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>me and ſtrengthnedſt me with ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> Hearty ſervent prayer is one way of caſting our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the Lord; and in ſo doing, he hath promiſed to ſuſtain us; and ſurely he cannot but have much caſe (under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever burden) who hath an almighty arm to lean upon. How often had the backs and hearts too, of Gods perſecuted ſervants been broken, if they could not have poured out their ſouls to God? I noted above, from the Title of that Pſalm, that it is the practice<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.</note> of the afflicted and almoſt overwhelmed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to <hi>pour out their ſouls before the Lord.</hi> Other friends ſometimes can and will not, ſometimes would, and cannot relieve us.<note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, how can I?</hi>—But God wants neither pity nor power to help. Yet I here ſpeak not ſo much of actual deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as of that inward quiet and ſerenity, which prayer brings into the ſoul.</p>
               <p>3. The Spirit of prayer adminiſters a ground of ſtrong confidence to a ſoul under affliction. The more ſervent in prayer, the more lively are its hopes, the ſtronger its confidence, either of ſupport under, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance

from its afflictions, however that thereby ſome ſpecial good ſhall accrew to it. And it cannot be otherwiſe; for there are many precious Promiſes made to prayer; <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will</hi>

               <p>5. By this alſo, the ſanctification of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions is procured. It not only procures ſtrength to bear, but grace alſo to improve.

wicked man, to good; but it is by teaching him to pray. <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> when he was in affliction, <hi>beſought the Lord his God, and</hi>

                  <hi>humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him</hi>——Afflictions ſtir up prayer, and prayer ſactifies afflictions; and ſactified afflictions may be put into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of our choiceſt bleſſings.</p>
               <p>6. And this alſo (when the Lord ſees it good) procures a happy iſſue and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It is the means which God hath appointed. <hi>The ſorrows of Death compaſſed me, and the pains of Hell gate hold upon me—Then called I upon the name of the Lord</hi>—<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 3, 4, 7, 8.</note> and the iſſue was, <hi>God dealt bountifully with him, delivered his ſoul from death, his eyes from tears, and his feet from falling.</hi> Prayer rightly performed, hath this certain effect, to procure deliverance, with one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, unleſs God in his infinite Wiſdom, ſee it more for his glory, and for our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good, to be kept ſtill in the ſurnace; and this is ſuch an exception, as every gracious ſoul will gladly admit of. But I may yet riſe higher: The Spirit of Prayer, not only procures deliverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but deliverance in mercy; deliverance ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and that is a pledge of eternal deliverance. Others may be delivered, but theirs is not ſo much a Preſervation, as a Reſervation to ſome ſadder calamity; but there is this in Deliverance procured by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48822:103"/>
that the ſoul may be aſſured, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him good by it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are a few of thoſe infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which the Spirit of prayer brings along with it to Gods afflicted ſervants; but it is impoſſible, to enumerate all: Theſe are but as a cluſter or two, in compariſon of the full Vintage. Do but look over the precious promiſes made to the people of God in their ſtraits; take notice how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, how great things are promiſed, and ſo many are the Advantages which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer brings with it; for that is the key which opens thoſe Treaſuries, that ſets thoſe Conduits a running, and drains out the ſweetneſs and vertue of them.</p>
               <p>Thus you have each part of the Doctrine confirmed and made good: Let us now ſee what Improvement may be made of this comfortable Truth.</p>

               <p>1. Some ſcorn and deride it, thinking it a meer fancy: Tell them of <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> they are ready to ſcoff at it, or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">John 3. 4.</note> (as <hi>Nicodemus) how can theſe things be?</hi> This is Fanaticiſm, Melancholy, a meer dream of a few brainſick perſons: they will cry out as <hi>Feſtus</hi> againſt <hi>Paul, Thou art</hi>

Only this: Let ſuch know, that either extremity of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here, or eternity of torment hereafter,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48822:104"/>
ſhall convince them, that themſelves are poſſeſt with that madneſs which they charge upon others. When miſery is upon them, and they cannot pray, except the Lord give them up to deſperate madneſs (as he hath done ſome) to rage and blaſpheme, they will wiſh, Oh, for a heart to pray! Oh, that I had that Spirit of prayer, which I have ſo often ſcoffed at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, ſend for a godly Miniſter, a prayerful Chriſtian, as <hi>David</hi>

                  <hi>the Thorns,</hi> they will then know the benefit of prayer, either by the want of it, or, if God give them a heart to pray, by the exerciſe of it. Then to be able to pray with aſſiſtance and acceptance, will be worth ſomething. Or ſuppoſe, they never come into ſuch ſtraits, or be given up to a reprobate mind, or to deſperate hardineſs, if they be ſo far given up, as to <hi>blaſpheme the God of Heaven, becauſe</hi>

               <p>2. Some neither have, nor care for this Priviledge. It is a thing above their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: They never trouble their heads about
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48822:105"/>
it; nor ever conſider, whether it be a fancy or reality. As for afflictions, they either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves immunity, or if they ſhould fall into trouble, they cannot apprehend what good Prayer can do them; they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it will bring caſe or comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee theſe often to drink deepeſt of the Cup, who give themſelves moſt to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; beſides, they have better ſhifts, they have riches, friends, policy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead them more, than to go and whine out a prayer to God in their trouble. Let me tell theſe careleſs, ſenſleſs perſons, that ignorance and preſumption blind their ſouls, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get theſe ſad miſtakes. The reaſon why they think ſo ſlightly of this priviledge is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know it not; and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can they deſire it. I may ſay, as our Saviour to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, If thou kneweſt the gift of God</hi>—If you knew the<note place="margin">John 4. 10.</note> ſweet revivings, the overflowing comforts that a ſoul in troubles gets by earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, you would not ſo diſregard it: but alas! I cannot expect you ſhould eſteem what you know not, nor indeed can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, till experience teach you; yet in hope, that God may ſet in with my poor endeavours by his holy Spirit, I ſhall lay before you ſome conſiderations, which may ſhew the ſad condition of thoſe that want the Spirit of prayer: Eſpecially, in a time of affliction, which (by Gods bleſſing) may awaken you (and thoſe alſo I ſpake of in the firſt place) to labour for it.

1. Then, Conſider with what ſad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, afflictions come armed upon a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleſs perſon: they are not meer troubles, but temptations alſo: and it is a thouſand to one, he that cannot pray in an affliction, will both ſin and ſink under it.

               <p>4. Such as want the Spirit of prayer, are in danger of being tempted, to break out into curſes, imprecations, bleſpheming againſt God, or ſome ſuch dreadful courſes.

Well, but <hi>Job</hi> had the Spirit of God, which fortified him againſt ſuch temptations. But now, where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer is wanting (which teaches hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion, and bleſſing God) how apt are men to break out into curſing, dreadful imprecations, and horrid blaſphemies? you may note in that Scripture, moſt of thoſe things together. Much of that Chapter, is<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.</note> a threatning againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now obſerve what courſe men will take in theſe ſtraits: <hi>They forſake the waters of</hi>

So that they deſpiſe the promiſe of Gods help, looking upon it, as a little Brook, a poor contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thing). Now what courſe do they take? <hi>They rejoyce in</hi> Rezin (King of <hi>Syria) and in</hi> Remaliahs <hi>Son,</hi> Pekah <hi>King of Iſrael:</hi> but God will <hi>bring upon them the waters of the</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 16, 20, 21.</note> but this proved a diſtreſs, and not a refuge. Again, when they ſhall ſay unto you, <hi>Seek unto them that have familiar Spirits, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wizards that peep and that mutter</hi>—Here is a ſinful courſe; the wickedneſs whereof, is evinced by the following words [<hi>Should not a people ſeek unto their God?] q. d.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 19.</note> Should you not rather believe in God, and enquire of him by prayer?

This is that I am now ſpeaking of; they fall a curſing, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, grow deſperate. By all this, you ſee, how ſad it is to want a Spirit of prayer in a day of trouble: Into what ſnares men run themſelves, when they cannot go to God. Therefore do not make a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it: Think not the want of the Spirit of prayer, a ſmall thing: you know not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48822:109"/>
how ſoon God may change your condition; how ſoon affliction may faſten upon you: then the Spirit of prayer would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable advantage, and the want of it, will be found an unſpeakable want: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if by theſe ſinful ſhifts, you may keep off the blow for the preſent; yet ſin will increaſe, and you will by ſuch courſes, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. ult. &amp; 8. ult.</note> your <hi>portion will be to lye down in ſorrow,</hi> you will be driven into darkneſs.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond conſideration, that may ſhew the miſery of not having the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction, is this, that ſuch ordinarily loſe the benefit of affliction, to them it is<note place="margin">Ezek. 7. 5.</note> like to be <hi>an evil, an only evil.</hi> I deny not, but God may do good, and hath done good to very wicked men by afflictions: But I ſay, you cannot expect or promiſe to your ſelves any benefit, till you can pray in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The promiſes indeed are many, of<note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 9.</note> benefit by affliction. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged—I have ſent them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>into the Land of the</hi> Caldeans <hi>for their good—All things ſhall work together for good</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note>—<hi>But he</hi> (God chaſtneth us) <hi>for our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>profit, that we might be partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>—and the like. But all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes bring forth upon the knees of prayer. What is it for him, that hath no key, or way of entrance, to know of an infinite Treaſure? Theſe wells are deep; if you cannot draw them by the Bucket of prayer, what the better are you? Oh, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48822:109"/>
loſs, to loſe the benefit of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Thus may a prayerleſs ſoul bemoan it ſelf in trouble: This affliction (for ought I know) may be my ruine, it may be the <hi>Praeludium</hi> of eternal miſery; it may cut me off, and ſend me packing to Hell; or, if I live, I may live a miſerable comfortleſs life; I may be a very <hi>Cain,</hi> a Vagabond. Or, it may be to my further obduration, and ſo heighten and haſten my condemnation: Now, he that hath the Spirit helping him to pray in trouble, may be aſſured of a bleſſed iſſue, and a ſanctified improvement of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. But of this I ſpake ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Well, if you deſire to derive upon your ſouls, the influences of all thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed promiſes made to the ſuffering ſervants of God, get the Spirit of Prayer, otherwiſe you cannot be aſſured, that one of thoſe good things belong to you.</p>
               <p>3. Where a Spirit of prayer is wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, it is to be feared, that ſoul is in a ſtate of wrath. I will not be perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: In ſome caſes God may withdraw his Spirit from his people in affliction, when he intends to hold on their burden for ſome time; as it was with the Jews in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 23.</note> So foretold: <hi>Ye ſhall not mourn nor weep,</hi> (that is, towards God in prayer) <hi>but ye ſhall pine away in your iniquities, and mourn one towards another:</hi> and ſo fulfilled: <hi>All this evil is come</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God</hi>—Yea, ſometimes, the with holding of a Spirit of prayer, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48822:110"/>
as a puniſhment upon Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (of which I ſpoke in one of the Caſes above). Yet this I muſt needs ſay, Where a ſoul neither prayes, nor deſires to pray, nor ſees a neceſſity of prayer under trouble, but thinks of other courſes, any whither rather than to God, it is a ſhrewd ſign, that ſoul hath no intereſt in God: For afflictions are Gods Rod; and if we are children, we ſhall fall at his feet, when he takes his Rod in hand: and however the Sun-ſhine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity make a Child of God caſt off his Cloak (as I may allude to that Fable); yet the wind of Adverſity, would make him gird it cloſer about him. Though a courſe of peace, health, fulneſs, make the beſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forget their Rock; yet when miſery comes, they remember <hi>God is their Rock, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 35</note> 
                  <hi>the high God their Redeemer.</hi> The Text tells you, it is one of the great ſupports of a child of God in a day of trouble, to have <hi>the Spirit helping his infirmities.</hi> So that where the Spirit of ſupplication is wholly wanting, it is to be doubted, whether that ſoul hath the Spirit of Adoption. Though to pray in affliction, is not alwayes an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of having a Spirit of Prayer: for even wicked men may, and often do, pray in ſtraits; yet to be prayerleſs then, ſpeaks one void of the Spirit. Were there any praying diſpoſitions in the heart, afflictions would draw them out. But it may be, this is little to thoſe I am ſpeaking to; what if they be not children of God? What if they be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48822:110"/>
ſtrangers at the Throne of Grace? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh but make not light of ſuch a condition. What can I ſay worſe of a man on this ſide Hell, than to ſay, he is a child of wrath? To ſuch, God is an enemy, and all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations are in anger; his very bleſſings are curſed. That is a ſad word <hi>the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> it hunts and purſues<note place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> him, and (without repentance) will never leave, till it hath ſunk him into everlaſting perdition. Is this to be made light of? Or can you imagine a condition more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</p>
               <p>4. Add this alſo, that, where a ſoul under affliction, is void of the Spirit of prayer, the whole weight l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48822:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
What makes thee cry out of the want of the Spirits aſſiſtance? I hope thou art in good earneſt, thou dareſt nor ſo far wrong thy ſelf, as to ſay, thou doſt but diſſemble, while thou thus complaineſt, or that thou art not ſenſible, that, to have ſpirit of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, would be thy joy and the rejoycing of thy heart; as the want of it, is thy hearty grief—. This then being granted, I ask, Whence theſe ſad complaints proceed? not ſurely from any Principle in nature: thou ſeeſt many a carnal wretch, who goes from day to day, never lifts up his heart to God, never deſires to have this mercy, nor thinks it worthy the having. Nay, to come nearer, it may be thou thy ſelf canſt remember the time when thou couldſt have lien and lived in a prayerleſs courſe, when thou hadſt no ſenſe of the need of prayer, no eſteem of it, no deſire to it. Whence then is this change? Surely from the Spirit it is ſome degree of the Spirits operation, that makes thee feel and complain thou wanteſt it: when you hear a man complain of ſtopping and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathedneſs; Is it not an undenyable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a principle of life in him? the dead feel nothing, complain of nothing. I think I may lay it down, as an unqueſtionable Maxim, None can really value, heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the gifts and graces of the Spirit (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">Acts 8. 19.</note> upon ſuch an account as <hi>Simon Magus</hi>) but by the Spirit. So that from this very complaint (if ſenſible and ſerious) thou maiſt conclude, there is a reſidue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as I may ſay) of the Spirit in thee.</p>

Is it, that thou canſt not enlarge thy ſelf in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions? or pour out thy ſoul in ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14 2.</note> complaints? Thou canſt not <hi>take to thy ſelf words, and call upon the Lord?</hi> This doth not ſpeak thee void of the Spirit of prayer. It is I confeſs, a ſweet ability, and a great help, to affect our own hearts, when we can do it; but not of the eſſence of prayer. The Text hath enough to anſwer to this. The Spirits help ſometimes comes no higher, than to <hi>groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate ſighs, are prayer; a man may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter little, and be able to utter little, and yet pray much: Words are the leaſt part (if I may call them a part) of this duty.

Suppoſe it be at ſometimes as bad as thou makeſt it: that grace be at a low ebb, that thou art dead, ſenſeleſs, unapt, backward, lumpiſh, canſt ſcarce dragg thy ſelf into the preſence of God, and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, thou haſt neither words not heart to the duty: Is it alwayes thus?

may be, you will ſay, and that is it that is the ſting in my affliction. Had I never known what theſe things meant, I had not had this ſting in my affliction; but this is it that makes my cup exceedingly bitter, that I have ſinned away theſe mercies, and now want the Spirits help, when I moſt need it.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but the caſe is ſad, yet there is ſomething to allay it. For conſider, what child of God hath not ſometime felt and complained of the like?

Here is as much need of the Spirit of prayer, as in any other kind of affliction. <hi>Paul</hi> ſound Prayer his beſt weapon, and therefore hee made much uſe of it. <hi>For this I prayed thrice</hi>—More over, there are<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9 1 Cor. 1. 28</note> ordinary Troubles with few eſcape, <hi>Troubles in the fleſh,</hi> cares about the things of this life, ſuch as a man is born to, and as naturally<note place="margin">Job 5. 7.</note> ſubject to, as 'tis naturall for the <hi>ſparks to fly upward.</hi> Theſe will not be borne, or not as a Chriſtian ſhould bear them, without prayer for ſupport, direction, ſanctification: The moſt inconſiderable of theſe without divine ſupport (ſetch't in by prayer) will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to disſpirit, to overwhelm thee, to put beſides thy Patience. To conclude then, What need have wee to keep the Spirit our conſtant friend, that wee may have its aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in all exigencies? It is as needfull as prayer it ſelf is, and that is the very trade, the very lively hood of a Chriſtian, you may as well live without ayre or breath (as you are living Creatures), as to live without prayer (as your are Chriſtians). Therefore
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48822:117"/>
take heed you doe nothing whereby the Spirit may be eſtranged from you, or be provoked to withdraw his aſſiſtance; if you doe, it will be to your unſpeakable loſs and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>If you would be directed in this thing, Look back to the filth <hi>Caſe.</hi> So much to the firſt ſort.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond ſort of thoſe who know what it is to have the Spirits help, are thoſe who are under afflictions, and do find the great advantage of this precious Priviledge: to whom the Text is an experienced Truth, and they can ſay, <q>Except the Lord had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me his holy Spirit, I had ſunk under my but then; but through mercy, I am ſupported, I feel ſtrength renewed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as my burdens are renewed, I find there is no allay to trouble like this, even to pour out my ſoul to the Lord, which by the help of Gods Spirit I can do, in ſome weak meaſure, this is hearts-eaſe, I can upon this account glory in my (ſorrowful) infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me. Therefore I<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſeoutions, in diſtreſſes for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48822:118"/>
Chriſts ſake,</hi> (or in other Troubles that come upon me in the world); for when I am weak (in my ſelf) then (through the Spirits aſſiſtance) I am ſtrong.</q> If this be thy condition and experience, I have two words of Counſell to impart to thee.</p>
               <p>1. Uſe and improve to the utmoſt this great mercy, hold on in this duty; <hi>Continue in prayer,</hi> while thy trouble continues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I<note place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note> mean, that thou double and treble thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in reference to the Affliction thou art under, do as <hi>Paul, pray thrice</hi> (often);<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8. 2 Kin. 13. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>ſmite</hi> with this arrow <hi>not three times only, but ſix or ſeven,</hi> yea an hundred times. But not to ſpeak in the clouds, There is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold improvement, which you ſhould make of the Spirits help in trouble, all having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Affliction, and exceedingly tending to your advantage in it. Take them in order.</p>
               <p>1. Improve the Spirits help eſpecially to beg a bleſſing upon your affliction: be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for ſanctification, and ſpiritual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under it, be not ſo importunate to have the plaiſter taken off, as to have it made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to heal ſome ſpiritual diſtemper. Let thy ſoul breathe out ſuch deſires as theſe. <q>Lord make this ſtroak humbling, healing, quickning: May ſome corrupt blood run out at this wound: Let ſome hidden luſt be diſcovered; let my faith be reſined, my delight in thy wayes be increaſed, <hi>as my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 14. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>man decayes, let my inward man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day:</hi>
                  </q> Thus be more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48822:118"/>
to find the good of it, then to be freed from the evil of it, as thou ſeeleſt the ſmart, ſo be earneſt that thou maiſt find the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: ſuch prayers are according to the will of God, and therefore he will return a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer. <hi>Self</hi> may prompt us to beg eaſe and deliverance, but <hi>Grace</hi> ſhould teach us to beg ſpiritual advantage, eſpecially ſince the promiſes of doing us good by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction are ſo full, ſo many, and ſince there is not a ſhorter cut to a ſanctified delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than to have affliction ſanctified.</p>
               <p>2. Improve this mercy as an alleviating conſideration: do as thoſe that carry a heavy burden; they lay ſomething betwixt their ſhoulder, and the thing they carry, to make it lye eaſier. Put this conſideration betwixt thy ſhoulder and the burden, it will make it abundantly lighter, as you have already heard. Oh what a calming cheering thought may this be, <q>Well, though I am afflicted yet I am not caſt off. God ſtill holds me up with one hand, as he ſmites me with the other: while I have the bleſſed ſpirit of God to take by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy end and lift with me, how patient, how cheerful ſhould I be?</q> As it ſaid in a like caſe, <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>ſick; the people that dwell therein ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given their iniquity:</hi> which ſome thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, <hi>q. d.</hi> The people ſhall not be ſenſible of ſickneſs, and bodily diſtempers. Senſe of pardon, ſhall take away ſenſe of pain, their outward afflictions ſhall be as no affliction;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48822:119"/>
ſin, which is the ſting thereof being taken away. So may the ſoul under trouble which hath this great advantage, ſay, This trouble is nothing, ſo long as I can thus fetch in eaſe, ſupport and comfort.</p>
               <p>3. Improve it alſo as a preſervative from taking offence at the Croſs, or from taking indirect wayes to get from under it. For, think how unreaſonable a thing it were to be offended, to quarrel or murmure, when God doth abundantly compenſate the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of thy ſuffering, with the ſweetneſs of this experience; Or why ſhouldeſt thou go elſe where for eaſe and comfort, when thou haſt ſo ready a way to God? He hath laid a Croſs on thy back, but he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all put his Spirit within thee, and thereby thou canſt fetch in ſupport: this is enough to bear charges; be the journey (as I may ſay) never ſo long or chargeable: Thus argue; Why ſhould I go elſewhere? I can turn in to my Heavenly Father, I can <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 55. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>my ſelf to the Lord, and caſt my burden upon him, and he will ſuſtain me:</hi> What need I goe down to Egypt for help? why ſhould I wound Conſcience by baſe complyances? why ſhould I ask a guard of Kings? or fly for ſhelter to brambles with will but ſcratch and te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r mee, when I can, by Faith and Prayer, dwell in the ſecret place of the moſt high, and abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty? Is there not a God in Iſrael, and have I not that Spirit of Adoption whereby I can cry Abba Father? why ſhould I got
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48822:119"/>
to Baalzebub the God of Ekron? Through grace I will not ſin, <hi>nor charge God foolishly,</hi> If hee ſtrike harder, I will pray harder, and cry lowder. Thus emprove this precious mercy.</p>
               <p>2. The Second word of advice I have for ſuch, is this. Let thy returns of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for this mercy be neither ſtraitned nor ſlackned, becauſe of thy affliction: rather be more thankfull: delay not to pay God the praiſe due to him, nor pay him with the ſhorteſt. For conſider, this Priviledge is not only an allay to thy affliction, but it changeth the very nature of it, it turnes the Croſs into a bleſſing. This, I preſume will be readily acknowledg'd, that the worſt that can befall us is mercy; if it work for the beſt, if it improve and fit us for glory, if it make our graces more flouriſhing and vigourous, and ſhall make the Crown of glory more ponderous; Now this is the Effect of the Spirits help in prayer, it turns afflictions into advantages, our loſſes become our gain, and is there not cauſe of joy and thankfulneſs? What Paul ſaith of his bonds and impriſonment, I <hi>know this ſhall turn to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>my ſalvation,</hi> how? <hi>through your prayer and the ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> The ſame may you ſay of your troubles, Be they what they will, I know theſe ſhall turn to my ſalvation, I know theſe ſhall promote my eternall happineſs, through the ſupplies of the Spirit in Prayer. Therefore bleſs God, in the midſt of trouble, rejoyce in this mercy,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48822:120"/>
and the rather becauſe this will be a ſingular means not only to have the Spirits aſſiſtance continued, but to have it more increaſed. Thanksgiving is a duty that brings meat in the mouth of it: you cannot give God the praiſe of any mercy, but hee will add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy to it: The thankfull Leper, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his returning to give thanks receives an additionall Teſtimony, <hi>Goe thy way, thy faith</hi>

                  <hi>but he addes in the cloſe,</hi> 
                  <q>that together with his outward cleanſing, hee had obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, for the Samaritane is ſaved by his Faith; how? not only that hee was cured of his leproſy (ſo were the reſt) but becauſe hee was received into the number<note place="margin">So <hi>Deodate</hi> and others.</note> of God's Children, and had received this temporall cure as a pledge of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love to him.</q> Thus hee: With whom <hi>Beza</hi> ſeems to concur, thus gloſſing, <q>Chriſt doth good even to the unthankful</q>, but the benefits of God profit them only to

ſalvation who are thankfull. This I have hinted to ſhew the advantages that flow from thankfulneſs. Hee's thankfull for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mercy, Chriſt (according to their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,) aſſures him of eternall mercy: Well, let not your afflictions make you leſs thankfull, for the goodneſs of God in vouchſafing you his Spirit to help you in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: nay rather double your prayſes, for the ſweetneſs and ſeaſonableneſs of this mercy. Thus much to the ſecond fort.</p>

Now to help you in this, I thought I could not take a better courſe, then by propoſing and opening to you that excellent pattern given us by our Saviour, which being the <hi>Summa petendorum,</hi> the ſumme of things to be asked, may and ought to be the <hi>Norma petendi,</hi> our Rule and Directory in asking. Which, were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full I might commend to you from its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, perfection, brevity, comprehenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp;c. But I ſhall content my ſelf to ſay only this much: hee that well underſtands what is comprehended in each branch of this platform, and withall is ſenſible of his own condition, need not want either matter. Method or Expreſſion wherin to pour out his Soul to God.</p>
               <p>There are two things concerning which I would ſpeak a little, before I enter upon the prayer it ſelf. <hi>viz:</hi> 1. The occaſion. 2. The end of our Saviours leaving this upon record.</p>
               <p>1. For the occaſion it is obſervable that the two Evangeliſts that record it give us a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent account, and by comparing them wee may eaſily ſee that our Saviour did oftner then once commend it (as to the ſubſtance of it) to his Diſciples and others.</p>
               <p>1. This Evangeliſt makes it a part of that long and excellent Sermon preacht' by our Saviour in the mount, in which after many other excellent inſtructions, hee takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to teach them the right manner of Alm's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving

Every Tautology therefore is not a Battology, Then is length or repetition in prayer to be condemned, when its heartleſs, affected, or when wee think either to inform or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage God by our much ſpeaking, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, when it is the overflowings of a pious and devout ſoul, and tends to the warming and enlarging our own and others affections, or to expreſs the vehemency of our deſires. Well then, let us learn, as not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48822:127"/>
to condemn all prolixity and repetition in prayer, ſo to avoid that which is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. And give mee leave to ſay thus much: it were well if they that pretend to ſee a Moat in their Brother's eye (as to this matter) would firſt pull the beam out of their owne; and that the more deliberate and ſtudied forms of ſome were not equally (if not more) culpable of prolixity and Tautologies then the (ſo much decryed) extemporary conceptions of others: But to proceed, Our Saviour having untaught them theſe things doth in the ſecond place poſitively teach them how to pray, and that by propoſing this ſhort and excellent platform, which I am to ſpeak of. And ſo much for the account given, of the occaſion, by this Evangeliſt.</p>
               <p>2. The other Evangeliſt <hi>Luke:</hi> Chap. 11. 1.—tells us that our Saviour propoſed it upon the requeſt of one of his Diſciples having (as its probable) heard our Saviour himſelf pray: whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> note</p>
               <p>1. Others gifts excerciſed are apt to ſtir up a deſire in us of the like abilities.</p>
               <p>2. Its a Miniſters part to teach his people to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I obſerve it both from the argument this diſciple uſes, <hi>Teach us as John taught &amp;c.</hi>—It ſeems John did it; as alſo from our Saviour's ready condeſcenſion to the requeſt of this Diſciple: and I hope it will not be denyed that both of them did it as Miniſters, and Teachers of others: and if ſo, what account will they give who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48822:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a great meaſure to ſow up the mouths of Gods Miniſters, from the doing of this duty. It hath been ſaid that Example is the ſhorteſt and moſt effectuall way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but people muſt have little or nothing of their Miniſters example of the excerciſe of this gift in this duty, either to excite them to, or direct them in it, if it may be according to the deſire of many.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I obſerve, The Diſciples ignorance and inability was our great advantage, what an Ancient ſpeaks of <hi>Thomas</hi> his incrednlity, <hi>Minus mihi Maria profuit quae citius credidit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

But ſo much for the occaſion.</p>
               <p>2. For the end of it, Whether did our Saviour deliver it as a ſtanding form of words to be conſtantly uſed in our addreſſes to God; that wee ſhould pray (as ſome men have commanded us) thus, and no otherwiſe? or as a platform and Directory, by which to frame our prayers and petitions?</p>
               <p>A 1. I deny not but it may be lawfully uſed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48822:128"/>
in the very words of it as a prayer, provided it be with underſtanding, reverence, a heart enlarged in the ſenſe of the things peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for (as 'tis well obſerved by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> the ſhortnes of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cals for the greater enlargednes of heart) and that it be not made an Idol of, which in effect they doe who attribute more efficacy to the very words of it, then to the ſame petitions otherwiſe expreſſed; that it be not made a bolſter for Idlen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; who think it ſufficient if they mutter over the words of it Morning and Evening without underſtanding or attention, and reſt in it, never labouring to get abilities in prayer; nor muſt it be uſed as a charme, which they doe who think by repeating the words of it to fright away the Divell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor doe I think it inconvenient that it be made the cloſe of our prayers, that it be ſometimes repeated in publick, ſo that there be not a neceſſity of uſing it ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>2. But the chief end doubtleſſe was to be a platform and Directory, to guide us in the making our peti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions to God: to teach us, to whom, for what, for whom and in what manner wee muſt pray. And that this was the chief end of our Saviour in giving and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, theſe arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. By the words of Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>after this manner therefore pray yee,</hi> not in theſe words and ſyllables: and though it is objected that the other Evangeliſt ſeems to tye us up to the very words [when yee pray, ſay] yet
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48822:128"/>
wee need not underſtand him ſo ſtrictly. For in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 1. the Diſciple deſires that hee would teach them to pray as <hi>John</hi>—Now where have wee any form, or the leaſt intimation of a form preſcribed by <hi>John</hi> to his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſciples? But</p>
               <p>2. (Which may anſwer that objection) The two Evangeliſts doe conſiderably vary in their words and expreſſions, which ſurely they would not, had Chriſt intended the very words to be uſed as a form: it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been injoyned (as men now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne their formes) thus you ſhall pray and no otherwiſe. But ſo far is the Holy Ghoſt from tying us up to words, that hee ſeems to intimate the warrantableneſs of varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I think I may challenge the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe-minded to give an Inſtance of any thing twiſe related in Scripture, as the ſpeech of one to another, which in ſo few words hath ſo much variation. Let us compare the two Evangeliſts: In the Preface and 3 firſt Petitions they agree, in the latter part there is difference.</p>

               <p>3.

one <hi>Species</hi> or kind of ſin or duty, the whole <hi>Genus;</hi> ſo this platform ſuggeſts the generall heads of prayer, to which infinite particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are reducible: and though we find nothing in any of the prayers of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren recorded in Scripture but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to ſome of theſe heads, yet wee find them more particular in their Confeſſions, Petitions, and Thanksgivings.

Are not particular confeſſions of ſin a great evidence of our Sincerity in confeſſing, and a ſingular help to humble and affect us? as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to <hi>Achan, Joſh. 7. 19. My Son give I pray thee glory to the God of Iſrael and make confeſſion unto him:</hi> God is more glorified, and wee more ſhamed: ſo in petition, though God knows what wee want, yet hee would have us ſenſible of our wants, and ſhew him (as it were) the grieved place, <hi>Ja. 1. 5, If any man lack Wiſedome</hi> (and ſo of any other grace or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) <hi>let him ask it of God</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>1. Direct their prayers to God indeed, but not ſuch a God as hee hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſuch as they fancy him: <hi>who think God like themſelves,</hi> Pſal. 50. 21. It would be taken ill (and yet it is undoubtedly true) if I ſhould ſay, many never prayed to God in all their life though they have prayed much: for they which never had right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God but framed a falſe Idea and conception of him according to their own corrupt imaginations, never prayed to him, but to an Idol created in their own braine.</p>
               <p>2. They never directed their prayer to God as the Object, who never truſted in God, and expected from him the things
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48822:134"/>
prayed for: a man in reality prayes, not to him to whom hee ſpeakes, but to that in which hee truſts: Many ſpeak to God in prayer, but truſt in themſelves, in friends, in carnall refuges &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 17. 2. Early will I direct my prayer to thee and looke up:</hi> then is our prayer indeed directed to God when wee look up to him for the thing prayed for, with an eye of waiting and expectation.</p>
               <p>3. They doe not direct their prayers to God as the Object who have no ſenſe of that God to whom they pray: When there is no dread nor awe of his Majeſty, no truſt in his mercy &amp;c. And indeed what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt praying to a Stock or Stone, and to a God of whom wee have no other apprehenſions than as if hee were ſuch? Theſe (my Beloved) are more ſecret and cloſe acts of Idolatry (though no leſs ſinfull) which creep into the prayers of the beſt of Chriſtians too often.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning directing our prayers to God as the End (though it is not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here meant): then doe wee pray to God as our End, when it is in our hearts to deſire nothing but what may be to the glory of God: when in the cloſe of every petition or prayer wee put up, wee can from our hearts ſay, Lord what I ask is I hope for thy glory, I have beg'd every thing for this as my higheſt end, that I might glorify thee with and for it: if thou in thine infinite wiſedome ſeeſt it would not tend to the end for which I beg it, I deſire and beg a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48822:134"/>
of it: I know thy glory and my good are ſo twiſted together that nothing can be for my good which is not for thy glory. Now, how many pray to God as the Object, and yet to themſelves as the End? as <hi>Jam. 4. 2, 3.—ask amiſſe that they may conſume it upon their own luſt,</hi> and ſo inſtead of ſerving God, would ſerve himſelves of God.

               <p>1.

               <p>1. It helps againſt irreverence, and raſh preſumption: there's a naturall impreſs of Awe and Reverence upon the Spirits of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards a Father, there are indeed other Titles more apt to beget feare and trembling, but none more effectuall to ſtrike an awfull reverence of God upon the ſoul, this will make us rejoyce with trembling; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. and fill us with <hi>Reverence and Godly fear</hi> Hebr. 12. 28.</p>
               <p>2.

But the Title of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begets boldneſs, and gives encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: what may not a child hope to obtain from a loving and tender Father? 'Tis the loweſt Title to which humility could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, and the higheſt to which love could aſpire: This begets aſſurance that hee will give us, if not what wee ask, yet what
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48822:137"/>

               <p>3. It helps againſt that backwardneſs and unwillingneſs which wee are naturally ſubject to: wee are apt to withdraw from that duty, unwilling to begge: Now this title, ſweetens the duty to us, and invites to it. Little children take delight in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Father; when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſay, yet they will be calling Father: God would have us delight in duty, and therefore hee teaches us to come to him under this moſt endearing and encouraging Title.

not delight to converſe, with a Father, ſuch a Father?</p>
               <p>2. A diffident and diſtruſtfull Spirit: This much unbeſeems the Relation of Children to a Father (eſpecially ſuch a Father): wee ſhould not ask tremblingly having a Father to ask, a Son in whoſe name wee are taught to ask, a Spirit to indite our petitions, and ſo many Promiſes to plead, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1, 6. <hi>Ask in faith nothing doubting.

               <p>1. The firſt note of a child is, Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to his Father. It is not alwayes ſo as to earthly, but it is ſo, as to our Heavenly Father. God begets all his children, as <hi>Adam</hi>

               <p>3. Dependnece on the Father is the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and diſpoſition of a child (eſpecially in its minority); ſo it is with a child of God, his dependence is upon God, his hope in him, his expectation from him. <hi>Pſam. 39. 6. and 56. 3. and</hi> 4. ult. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. all theſe and abundance more of clear Scriptures declare that the whole affiance of a child of God is in his heavenly Father. How is it with us? where is our confidence? It may be wee goe to God, when wee want a mercy, and wee are not ſo atheiſticall but wee will acknowledge that wee cannot have it without Gods giving; yet, Doe wee not more rely on the Phyſician then on God for our health? more on our owne wiſdom, or friends advice then on Gods providence for the management of our affairs? Oh, there lies much of ſecret. Atheiſm in this, when wee pray to God, yet rely on our ſelves or others: well, but if thou art indeed a child, thou haſt learnt to commit thy way to the Lord, to eaſt thy burden upon him, to intruſt thy ſelf and all thy concernments in his hand.

Surely, it is an high affront to the Majeſty of heaven, that ſinfull duſt and aſhes ſhould dare to entitle it ſelf to him in that ſpeciall Relation without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt: ſuch preſumption cannot but be highly provoking. That many are guilty of it, may appear by theſe t woor three convincing evidences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:48822:143"/>1. The notorious ignorance of many about Chriſt, and his mediatory office. I may ſay as the Apoſtle 1 Cor. 15. 34. <hi>Many have not the knowledge of God</hi> (ſo of Chriſt) <hi>I ſpeak it to your ſhame.</hi> They have the name of Chriſt often in their mouths (it may be to ſwear by it) but alas! they are utterly ſtrangers to any diſtinct knowledge of him: what hee is, or how hee is made ours, or how wee are to come to God by him, are to them unintelligible Myſteries, and as a book ſealed. Now it is impoſſible they ſhould come to God by Chriſt, who are groſsly ignorant in theſe things: Knowledge of Chriſt is neceſſarily preſuppoſed to intereſt in him, and without intereſt there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by him Oh think how often many of you have called God <hi>Our Father,</hi> and yet are ignorant of the <hi>Son,</hi> by whom hee is Our Father.</p>
               <p>2. The palpable unbelief of many evinceth their guilt in this particular. Faith is the ground of our Intereſt, and the hand with which wee take hold of Chriſt. But alas! may I not take up the Prophet's complaint?<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48822:143"/>
it is a ſad ſign that ſuch never knew what it was to beleeve, that come ſo lightly by it, and can keep it up conſtantly without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or interruption: But let mee ask you, Where had you your faith? by what means came you by it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing</hi> &amp;c. Did you ever experience your hearts bowed and perſwaded by the word to cloſe with Chriſt? Again, what effect hath your faith upon your heart? if true, it <hi>purifies the heart</hi> Acts. 15. 9. Where are the fruits of it that ſhould demonſtrate it to others? faith is no better than dead, if alone, <hi>Shew mee thy faith by thy works.</hi> Jam. 2. 14.—Alas! are not the irregular, and Atheiſticall lives of many men undeniable evidences of their infidelity? what ſurer demonſtration of unbelief raigning in the heart then impiety and profaneneſs prevailing<note place="margin">Pſal. 36 1.</note> in the life? ſo that as, <hi>the Transgreſſion of the wicked ſaid in</hi> Davids heart (<hi>i. e.</hi> convinced and perſwaded him) <hi>that there was no fear of God before his eys;</hi> ſo may I ſay, that the open debauchery, fraud, oppreſſion, atheiſme, uncleanneſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of many ſay plainly that there is no faith in their hearts: and where there is no true faith, it is impoſſible the ſoul ſhould come to God by Chriſt, ſince faith is abſolutely requiſite in that caſe.</p>
               <p>3. The Phariſaiſm and ſelf-confidence of many, ſhews they doe not come to God by Chriſt. For, to depend on Chriſt, and on our owne righteouſneſs are diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2, 3. Now doe not moſt of

               <p>2.

a piece of Atheiſme to limit God there: <hi>Joh</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14. To ſuppoſe God confined within the circuit of heaven, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what is done on earth, is the next way to become an Atheiſt.

               <p>Secondly, Are wee to imagine (which would follow upon the former) that God muſt locally deſcend from heaven, when hee heares or gives anſwer to our prayers: his being in heaven doth not (nor muſt is in our conceptions of him) ſuppoſe him at a diſtance from us on earth; wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that of <hi>David, Pſam.</hi> 139. 1,—12. that hee is <hi>preſent with us,</hi> that hee hath <hi>beſet us behind and before</hi> &amp;c. that hee is <hi>intime noſtro intimior,</hi> nearer us than wee are to our ſelves.

But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By his being in heaven; wee are to underſtand that more ſpeciall and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation of himſelf which hee there vouchſafes to the Angels and glorified Spirits: the more immediate exhibitions

               <p>2. (For it is ſufficient to name theſe things) To beget in our hearts awfull and reverentiall apprehenſions of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; the place ſpeaks his ſublimity, and he ſpeaks in us humility.

               <p>3.

               <p>4.

to them, as ſome now fancy in our publick-places of aſſembly: let us but judge by the place where they had their Proſeuchae <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. 13. out of the City, <hi>by a Rivers ſid,</hi> it is more than probable that conveniency, or neceſſity, or both, might prompt to the choiſe of ſuch a place, not any conceit of ſanctity in it, either before or after. Let men aſcribe what conveniency or decency they pleaſe to the Fabrick of Churches; but take heed of imagining in them any ſanctity (except they will call the peculiar appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of them to the ſervice of God, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity) or efficacy to further us in the ſucceſs of our prayers: even then when God had made peculiar promiſes to a place (<hi>viz.</hi> the Temple) yet hee had not confined himſelf there, but if in the field, or when carried a far off into their enemies land they ſhould<note place="margin">1 Kings 7. 46, 49.</note> there call upon God, hee was as able to hear, and as ready to help them. 'Tis a ſweet conſideration that in all places God is nigh unto us in all that wee call upon him for, and that being in heaven hee is equally preſent to the faithfull in any place on earth.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken thus much to the Preface, I now come to enter upon the body of this ſweet platform of prayer: which I ſhall not otherwiſe divide than according to the generally received partition, into 6. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, the three firſt, relating to God, the three latter to ourſelves. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by Gods aſſiſtance, to tye up my ſelf to a ſingle Sermon upon each Petition, and therefore ſhall crave your greater dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in attention, as fearing that my thus confining my ſelf, will both occaſion a more ſuccinct handling of them, and will hinder mee from my accuſtomed manner of repeating what I deliver.</p>
               <p>Before I enter upon the <hi>Petitions</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be neceſſary to give ſome general Rules and Propoſitions, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them, and of what I ſhall ſpeak to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. And let the firſt be this (which I have but juſt now hinted) The Petitions
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48822:152"/>
naturally divide themſelves (as I may ſay) into two Tables: the three firſt concern Gods glory, and the means conducing thereunto, (yet ſo as that our good is intwiſted with it); the 3. latter concern our good both here and hereafter. And from this order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion wee may take out theſe Leſſons; which I ſhall content my ſelf only to name here, as having occaſion to ſpeak to ſome of them (at leaſt), in handling the particular Petitions.</p>
               <p>1. Gods glory and what immediately tends to it, is to have the chief place in our prayers.</p>
               <p>2. So indulgent is the Majeſtie of heaven, that having ſought his glory hee allows us to ſeek our own good, Spiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>3. Yet our good, is to be ſought by us in conjunction with, and ſubſerviency to, Gods glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> 2. Every Petition implies an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſomething, (as you will hear in the particular handling more fully); for Iuſtance, <hi>Hallowed be the name,</hi> implies an acknowledgment both that God is worthy to be ſanctified, and that wee are unable to ſanctify him without his enabling grace. So, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes</hi> imports an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our ſins, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> 3. Every Petition includes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the good thing asked, the Means
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48822:152"/>
for the effecting or obtaining of it: and deprecates all hindrance to it, and (as all other prayers doe) puts an engagement on them that pray for it, to uſe their juſt and lawful endeavours for the effecting or obtaining of it: for Inſtance, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates the hindrances, <hi>viz.</hi> Sathan's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, includes the means <hi>viz.</hi> the free paſſage of the Goſpel &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And engages every one that prayes for it to endeavour in his ſtation that the Kingdom of God may come, and that He alone may Reign: ſo that in each ſingle Petition (as wee ſhall ſee) there are many infolded and included.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> 4. What wee begge for our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the places and conditions wee are in, wee doe alſo beg for others according to their places and conditions (for each Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relating to our ſelves is in the plural) and wee doe thereby engage our ſelves, as wee can, to help them to that thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> 5. Under one particular or <hi>Species</hi> in any Petition expreſſed, the whole <hi>Genus</hi> or kind is included; as under <hi>Bread</hi> all neceſſary food, and again under neceſſary food, all other neceſſaries relating to this life; as health, rayment, habitation, preſervation from evils in our bodies, names, eſtates &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> 6. This Pattern, is ſo perfect and comprehenſive, that there is nothing wee can or ought to beg, but it is reducible to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48822:153"/>
ſome head in it, yea (as in the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> ſo here) the ſame thing in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects is reducible to ſeveral Petitions: as all that wee ask in the following, are reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as means to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Thus to beg faith may in ſeveral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relate to every of the Petitions as you may eaſily diſcern by the reſpect it hath to each: and hence will follow that wee cannot give a full and exact account of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars included in the Petitions, only ſuch generall heads as may point out the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; ſo that, what <hi>David</hi> ſaith of Gods law wee may ſay of the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 96.</note> broad, and (as the Jews ſay) upon every tittle hangs a Mountain of ſenſe: <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>liar, yet ſublime; of few parts yet compleat, and comprehenſive of what ever wee may or ſhould ask in reference to Gods glory, to our owne temporal ſpiritual or eternal good. And indeed this brevity, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctneſs, and comprehenſiveneſs of it ſpeaks at once the infinite and divine wiſdom of Chriſt (for there's wiſdom to comprehend the <hi>Iliads</hi> in a nut-ſhell, to reduce the almoſt infinite concernments of God and man to ſo few heads, and comprize them in ſo few words) as alſo his ſingular condeſcenſion and reſpects to man's infirmities. As in the Law, God hath Epitomized duty, ſo here our Saviour hath Epitomized the things wee are to pray for; and both in condeſcenſion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48822:153"/>
to, and compliance with, mans weakneſs and infirmity.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe few things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I ſhall now enter upon the <hi>Petitions</hi> in particular: the firſt whereof reſpects imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately that which ſhould be our laſt and higheſt end <hi>viz.</hi> the Glory of God. <gap reason="foreign">

But as the opinion is ſingular, ſo the verb here being in the ſame mood as in the following Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpeaks this to be of the ſame nature with the following: I conclude it therefore
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48822:154"/>
to be a Petition, the ſenſe whereof wee ſhall better underſtand by explaining the Terms of it. 1. <hi>What is meant</hi> by <hi>the name of God?</hi> 2. What by <hi>ſanctifying?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>[<hi>Hallowed</hi> or <hi>ſanctified</hi>] To open that word, take the following Concluſions.</p>
               <p>1. Man is ſaid to ſanctify himſelf, or others: thus God commands the Iſraelites to <hi>ſanctifie to him their firſt born:</hi> Exod. 13. 2. and the Prieſts to <hi>ſanctify themſelves, Exod.</hi> 19. 22. In this ſenſe, to ſanctify is to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ſet a part to God a thing or perſon, or to prepare for any ſpeciall ſervice.</p>
               <p>2. God is ſaid to ſanctify Man which is, either to chooſe him to ſome peculiar office, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 44. Or elſe to infuſe habits of graces, and make him holy by reall communications of the graces of his Spirit: of which 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. and many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>3. God is ſaid to <hi>ſanctify himſelf. Numb.</hi> 20. 13. when hee vindicates himſelf from any diſhonour or wicked reflexions of mens ſins. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 23. <hi>I will ſanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen,</hi> which ye have profaned in the midſt of them: <hi>i. e.</hi> I will wipe off the reproach which your miſcarriages have brought upon my Name amongſt the Heathen. Thus God ſanctified himſelf upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. See alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 16. But amongſt his own people, God is ſaid to ſanctify himſelf when hee reſtores to them the purity of his worſhip <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 41. or delivers them from any grievous affliction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 25. <hi>and</hi> 39. 27. In a word when God by any
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48822:155"/>
ſignall providence declares what hee is; or writes any of his attributes ſo legibly upon his Providences that men may plainly read it, hee doth herein ſanctifie himſelf.</p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, Man is ſaid to ſanctify God: <hi>Iſa. 8. 13. Sanctify the Lord of hoſts himſelf</hi>—that is, not to make, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare God holy and glorious: to acknowledge him to be what hee is, and to aſcribe to him what ever ſpeaks his tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. In a word, to refer our whole life and all our actions and endeavours, to his glory, according to that. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
               <p>Now the two laſt ſenſes are proper to this Petition. <hi>Let thy name be ſanctified</hi> both by thy ſelf and by us thy Creatures; doe thou reveal thy glory, and enable us to acknowledg and celebrate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And, by the way, it is well obſerved<note place="margin">Sr. Rich. Baker.</note> how generally theſe Petitions run that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to God. It is ſaid <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> Not [by us] leſt wee make the Muſick of too few voices: <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> not [to us], leſt wee aſſign God too ſmall a Territory: <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> Not [by us] leſt wee ſtint God to too few Servants. But wee ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> and ſtop there that no mouth may be ſtopt from glorifying God. <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come</hi> but not [whither], becauſe wee ſhould deſire its coming into all places.</q> 
                  <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> Not [by whom] becauſe it ſhould be done by all: The ſenſe then of this Petition may be given in theſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48822:155"/>
Scriptures, <hi>Pſam. 80. 12. Thou that dwelleſt between the Cherubins</hi> ſhine forth—and <hi>Pſal. 21. 13. Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine owne ſtrength</hi>—And Pſal. 57. 5, 11. <hi>Be thou exalted O God above heavens, let thy glory be above all the earth.</hi> Theſe may expreſs it as it relates to Gods ſanctifying himſelf: And then as it relates to our ſanctifying of him: <hi>Pſ. 67. 3, 5. Let the people praiſe thee, O God, yea let all the people praiſe thee,</hi> may be a good expoſition or Paraphraſe upon it. So <hi>Pſal. 13. 18. &amp;c.</hi> The more particular explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I reſerve to the Application. The Point is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>6</label> The gloryfying or ſanctifying of Gods name ſhould be our chief Petition in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God by prayer. This needs no great proof: that one Scripture ſpeaks fully to it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Whether yee eat or drink—doe all to the glory of God. If every thing, if our naturall and civil, much more our religious actions: and if the glory of God muſt be the higheſt end of our prayers, it clearly followes that it muſt be firſt and chief in our Petitions, as well as in our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I ſhall for further clearing the thing, and preventing miſtakes, briefly anſwer a 3. ſold Query, and then apply it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Is it neceſſary that wee ſhould alwayes keep this order in our Petitions? muſt wee alwayes pray in the firſt place, that Gods name may be ſanctifyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The glory of God ſhould alwayes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48822:156"/>
fit higheſt in our hearts: and all our deſires and Petitions ſhould be ſubordinate to this as their end, and (as far as wee can diſcern) directed to it: ſo that all wee ask ſhould be, implicitly and intentionally, Petitions that Gods name may be ſanctified, ſince in what ever wee ask wee ſhould chiefly intend this; and our deſires ſhould be ever bounded with this as the condition: if wee ask outwards, health, riches, deliverance <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, grace or comfort, ſtill wee muſt have an ey to this mark: and the nearer any thing comes to this mark, the more intenſe may our deſires be, and the move earneſt our Petitions about it. So that though I doe not conceive it alwayes neceſſary to pray or begin our prayers in theſe or the like words, yet that wee are hereby taught both what to pray for with the greateſt intenſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> things that have a more immediate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible tendency to Gods glory; as alſo with what intention to pray for all wee pray for, <hi>viz.</hi> that wee or others may be in a better capacity to glorify God: That Text <hi>Matth. 6. 33. Seek firſt</hi>—&amp;c. doth not mainly intend order of <hi>time,</hi> but of <hi>dignity: firſt i. e. mainly,</hi> principally with the greateſt earneſtneſs, ſeriouſneſs, induſtry. So that the Order of this Petition, doth not ſo much teach us in what order to begin as to what end wee ſhould order and direct our prayers.</p>
               <p>2. Yet in reaſon, that which ſhould be higheſt in our intentions ſhould ordinarily be firſt in our Petitions. I ſay not, that it is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48822:156"/>
abſolutely neceſſary that ſo it ſhould be, but ſurely in Reaſon that which concerns Gods glory and our ſpiritual good ſhould have the precedency in an ordinary courſe. That wee give God his glory, before wee ask him to give us what makes for our good, is very reaſonable. Though (as wee ſometimes diſpatch ſmaller buiſneſſes that mee may be more fit and free for the main, ſo) it may not be amiſs ſometimes to diſpatch ſome Petitions for outwards which may be urgent and preſſing upon us, that they may not hinder in our more ſpiritual, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concernment. But this I make not a rule for our ordinary practiſe, but only an expedient in ſome urgent and extraordinary Caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But what neceſſity at all of ſuch a Petition, ſince God will ſee to that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſince hee will infallibly earry on that as his grand deſign, nor can our prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Were it but to teſtify our deſire, it were ſomething: ſince that is our great end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Our prayers ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the workings of our hearts towards it: nor doth the certainty of Gods effecting any thing ſuperſede our prayers or endeavours about it: nay rather if the thing be any way our concernments and within the compaſs of a promiſe, certainty of the event ſhould edge our prayers, (indeed wee can pray for nothing abſolutely, except wee know God
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48822:157"/>
will, or hath promiſed to effect it). The decrees of God bring-forth upon the knees of prayer: when God had bound himſelf<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> by promiſe for the Jews reſtauration, hee will yet be enquired of, that hee may doe it: it's no ſmall evidence of the Truch of grace when our prayers Eccho back Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and when the breathings of our hearts are after the accompliſhment of God's grand deſign in the world.</p>
               <p>2. But beſides; 'tis our concernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ſenſe of the Petition (as hath bin hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is this; Lord, ſanctify thy name and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to ſanctify it: That God ſhall be glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is certain; but, that wee may be amongſt that number that give him the glory due to his name, ſhould be the earneſt and moſt importunate deſire of our ſouls. Eſpecially ſince,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Upon the ſanctifying of Gods name by us, depends our happineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to hallow or ſanctify the name of God in glory is our very happineſs. What is our hope, or what ſhould be our deſire but to be admitted to joyne with the heavenly Quire in ſinging glory, honour, and praiſe to God for ever and ever? This is their both work and wages; and this is the import of the Petition: <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord, enable us ſo to ſanctify thy name on <hi>earth,</hi> that wee may both glorify thee and bee glorified with thee in heaven; And who will ſay, This is a needleſs or frivolous Petition?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:48822:157"/>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why is this firſt in order? (though wee have partly hinted already) yet take this ccount.</p>
               <p>1. This is the higheſt end of our Creation and ſhould be of all our actions (as hath bin ſhewd once and again). Now, the chief end ſhould be firſt in the intention: this is as the Sea out of which all our Petitions ſhould iſſue, and into which they ſhould empty themſelves.</p>
               <p>2. This chiefly intended, is as the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits that make the lump holy, as the altar that ſanctifies the gift: when wee have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this as our end, and praefixt it to our players, what ever elſe wee ask (keeping our eye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xt on this) is wel-pleaſing to God: yea though wee ſhould miſtake in the particular, God will excuſe it: If wee ask according to<note place="margin">1 John. 5. 14.</note> his will hee heareth us; now if wee ſincerely intend his glory in our asking, wee cannot but in the generall ask according to his will, though hee may ſee good to withold the particular thing wee pray for. David de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to <hi>build God a houſe</hi> (herein propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<note place="margin">1 Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 18. 2 Sam. 7. 11.</note> to himſelf the glory of God.) God approves and rewards this deſign, though hee will not permit <hi>David</hi> himſelf to effect his deſign. So that when this is ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it facilitates and opens the way for the attainment of other bleſſings: all that wee ask after, and in ſubordination to this, ſhall either be given or denyed, in mercy. 'Tis a grand failure in prayer, when wee ask to<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> waſte upon our luſts, and 'tis a ſingular

excellency, when a ſoul can reflect upon his prayer, and ſay, hee hath askt nothing but what hee conceives might tend to the glory of God, and might enable him for that end, otherwiſe hee would not have askt it.</p>
               <p>3. And it is fit wee ſhould prefer God and his grand concernment to our owne. Are not wee his Creatures, his Servants, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Should not the Servant gird himſelf and ſerve his Maſter before himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 8? Should a ſervant that is wholly maintained by another ſeek himſelf in the firſt place? God made us for himſelf <hi>Prov. 16. 4. Rom.</hi> 11. ult. and therefore wee ſhould make him our principall end: That wee firſt or chiefly pray for Gods glory and the means of it, is a duty that reſults from our Relation to God; That wee may afterward ask for our ſelves is a mercy, flowing from Gods condeſcenſion and compaſſion towards us: ſo that wee ſee, There is all the reaſon in the world why Gods glory ſhould be chief in our intention, when wee pray, if not alwayes firſt in our expreſſion.</p>

In this Petition is implyed an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of your own and others inability for this high imployment: this (as you have heard) is part of the ſenſe of this Petition, to beg of God grace and ability wherewith to glorify him. So that it is an implicit acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our own inſufficiency: This may be done in <hi>Pauls</hi> language, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves:</hi> or in that of the Levites. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 5. or of <hi>David</hi> Pſam. 106. 2. <hi>Who can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So likewiſe you may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the backwardneſs of your hearts, the coldneſs, and ſtraitneſs of your affections, implyed in that Petition of <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 51. 15. Thus may you occaſionally enlarge on theſe things.</p>
               <p>2. As there is ſomething acknowledged, ſo there is ſomething begged, I mean parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things under this generall. I ſhall reduce what is included by way of Petition, to theſe two general heads.</p>
               <p>1. Wee are, according to this Petition, to pray that God will glorify himſelf, that hee will doe that which moſt tends to his owne glory: which wee may doe in the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48822:161"/>
words of the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſam.</hi> 57. 5, 11. <hi>and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As our Savior, Joh. 12. 28. Father glorify thy Name.</note> 115. 1. and in order to this end that hee will both remove what ever darkens his glory, and bring about the things that moſt tend to the advancement of it. Since as you heard in the Propoſitions premiſed, each Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition implies a deprecation of the hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and prayer for what tends to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the thing prayed for: Now it would be infinite here to ſumme up all the particular hindrances of, or means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the glory of God: I ſhall only hint a few generals.</p>
               <p>1. Then, as to the impediments of Gods glory, there are three more generall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the honour of God is darkned and Ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world, which (in complyance with this Petition) wee muſt pray againſt.</p>
               <p>1. That Idolatry and falſe Worſhip which raignes in a great part of the world: this is a black cloud that darkens the name of God; hereby the glory due to God is given to others, and his praiſe to graven Images, Divels, and thoſe that are no Gods. The hoſt of heaven, Angels, men, bruits, ſtocks and ſtones &amp;c. rob God of his glory: Oh, how ſhould wee wreſtle with God that theſe <hi>Dagon</hi>'s may fall before his Ark? Turn that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 6, 7. into prayer, <hi>Let the heavens declare thy righteouſneſs, O Lord, and all the people ſee thy glory. Confounded be all they that ſerve graven Images that boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Idols</hi>—Plead the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for the converſion Idolatrous nations
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48822:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they may ſay with <hi>Ephraim</hi> Hoſ. 14. 8. <hi>What have I to doe any more with Idols?</hi> that their <hi>Idols of Silver, and Idols of Gold which they made each one for himſelf to worſhip may be caſt to the moles and to the bats,</hi> Iſa. 2. 20. That hee will turn to the people <hi>a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> Zeph. 3. 9. <hi>So that there may be one Lord and his name one</hi> Zech. 14. 9. And that <hi>from the riſing of the Sun even unto the goeing down of the ſame his</hi>

                  <hi>name may be great among the Gentiles,</hi> and in every place <hi>incenſe may be offered to his name, and a pure offering, and his name may be great among the Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Blaſphemy of Gods name, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the wicked's miſtakes and miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of his providences: It pleaſes the Lord often to obſcure his way <hi>Pſam.</hi> 77. 19. And his providences ſeem for a time to ſavour the wicked <hi>Pſal. 73. 3, 4, 5. Job:</hi> 21. 8-14. Hence they gather ſad concluſions, diſhourable to God, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Godly, though at laſt deſtructive to themſelves: and hereby Gods glory is for the preſent much eclipſed, when God ſeemes to ſavour the wicked, and to frown upon his own people, when <hi>they that work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48822:162"/>
that the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, and that the fooliſh people have blaſphemed thy name. Ariſe, O God, plead thine owne cauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the fooliſh man reproacheth thee daily: forget not the voice of thine enemies</hi>—Wee are to pray that God will <hi>fill their faces with ſhame</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 83. 16, 18. that hee will ſanctify himſelf upon them. That hee will haſten the time when <hi>judgment ſhall return unto righteouſneſs, and the upright in heart may</hi>

               <p>3. The profaneneſs, atheiſm, impiety, and all manner of iniquity that reigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that profeſſe and call upon his name. How doe the vile miſcarriages of thoſe that profeſs themſelves worſhippers of the true God obſcure his glory, and make his name to ſtink amongſt Pagans and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? This therefore wee ſhould with all earneſtneſs beſeech the Majeſty of heaven, that all that name his Name <hi>may depart from</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note>

That no profeſſing Chriſtian may be a profeſſed Atheiſt, a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall blaſphemer of that holy name whereby hee is called. Thus for the impediments to be deprecated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:48822:162"/>2. As to the means whereby God may glorify himſelf and which wee are to pray for in order thereunto, they are infinite: nor ſhall I trouble you with particulars: a few Inſtances may ſerve. Pray wee then that God will diſcover himſelf, that hee will ſhine forth and diſplay his glorious attributes to the world, <hi>Pſal. 80. 1, 2. and</hi> 94. 1, 2. That hee will make himſelf known <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. 2, 3. That men may know that <hi>hee whoſe name alone is Jehovah is the moſt High over all the earth:</hi> for if his Name were known aright, it would be glorified. Again: That hee will <hi>take to himſelf his great power and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 17</note> 
                  <hi>Reign;</hi> That hee ſo rule all the affairs of the world, as that each wheel may move in a direct tendency to his glory. Again that the Goſpel may be propagated, Infidels, Heathens, Turks, Pagans, and Idolaters Converted: That hee will confound the wicked, and make bare his arme in the ſignall and ſeaſonable deliverances of his Church and people. In a word, that all the tranſactions of God in the world may be ordered to the moſt advantagious way of glorifying his great Name. This is the firſt generall included in this Petition.</p>
               <p>2. Wee are alſo according to this Petition to pray that wee and others may be enabled to glorify him, that he will frame our hearts to praiſe him, and fill our mouths with his glory; That all the creatures may be as a well-turned Inſtrument harmoniouſly ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth the glory of their Creatour. In

this ſenſe may wee uſe that (ſo often quoted) Scripture, <hi>Pſal. 67. 3, 5. and</hi> 51. 15. And here alſo wee may amplify in deprecating hindrances and a begging bilities. To touch on each,</p>
               <p>1. Pray we (in complyance with this Petition) that God will remove from us and others whatſoever hinders us from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that tribute of glory due unto his name: for inſtance, that ignorance and blindueſſe that Reigns in the world: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it is poſſible that ſome who <hi>know God</hi>

               <p>2. And (as to Helps) pray wee that God will work in us thoſe abilities, give us

thoſe graces, beſtow on us thoſe bleſſings, and afford us thoſe opportunities, whereby, with, and for which, wee may moſt ſanctify him. It would be infinite to particularize: indeed to reckon up the means relating to this part of the Petition, would be to run through the whole duty of man, and all the other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are but means ſubordinate to this: yet to inſtance in ſome things, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing hereunto.</p>
               <p>1. Pray for the ſanctifying work of Gods Spirit upon your hearts. 'Tis impoſſible you ſhould ſanctify Gods name aright, till hee ſanctify your nature: man indeed was a well tuned inſtrument, fitted to celebrate the glory of his Creatour, but the Fall him quite out of order, and no hand but his that made, can mend it.

That as he hath made us for that end, he will ſo diſpoſe of us that we may be alwayes inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall for it: That all his providences may both adminiſter matter and excite our hearts to praiſe him: to this purpoſe you may borrow the words of <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30. 8, 9. <hi>Give mee neither poverty nor riches</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>left I ſhould be full and deny thee,</hi> and ſay, Who is the Lord.—Or left I ſhould be poor and ſteal and take thy name in vain. <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord I find my heart in either

matter of your Petition. It is eaſy to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify in words upon this or any other of the Petitions, but not ſo eaſy to get a right frame of ſpirit. Therefore,</p>

Then are our prayers right when our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are much wider then our expreſſions: when it is with us in this caſe as it was with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 32. 18. When wee are full of matter, and the ſpirit within us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us: when our belly is as wine which hath no vent, and ready to burſt like new bottles.</p>

               <p>3.

'Tis a cheap thing to ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> but when wee ſay and ſtand to it; when wee reſolve to live up to this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and lay downe all in proſecution of what wee pray for in it; this is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and a reſolution neceſſary, and becoming thoſe that pray thus. I would therefore ſay to ſuch profane ones as live to Gods diſhonour, as <hi>Pſam.</hi> 50. 17. What haſt thou to doe to take the Name of God into thy mouth? Either forbear to pray this prayer with your lips, or reſolve to proſecute it in your lives. The carnall perſecuting Jews who hated and eaſt out their Brethren for the Name of Chriſt, could ſay, <hi>Let the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord be gloryfied:</hi> but, Were they any thing better for ſaying ſo? no, God will appear to his people's joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed. Oh, remember as often as you take up this Petition into your mouths, you take upon you to proſecute the Ends of it in your lives,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48822:166"/>
and as often as you act any thing derogating from Gods glory, you contradict your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in your practiſes: Therefore pray this Petition, but pray it with a ſuitable frame and reſolution, and proſecute it with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable endeavours.

               <p>THis and the following Petitions are all ſubordinate to the firſt, and may be lookt on as means conducing to that as their End.

This ſecond Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> ſeemes chiefly to relate as a means to the firſt branch of the firſt Petition: then God ſanctifies himſelf when hee takes to him his great power and raignes, I ſay chiefly though not ſolely. The 3d. Petition relates moſt properly as a means to our ſanctifying God: then do we indeed ſanctify him, when we do his will
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48822:166"/>
ſincerely and univerſally. And the 3. latter Petitions are, for Advantages, and Abilities to what wee pray for in the former Petitions. This Petitions then, as having the moſt immediate tendency to the promoting of Gods glory is fitly put in the next place, and fitly precedes the third, for till Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come, his will cannot be done as it ought to bee. Gods people will never be a willing people till the day of Gods power. I ſhall obſerve the ſame Method in this and the reſt, as in the firſt.</p>

By this he rules the affairs of his Church, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, governing and defending it, carrying on his people by his grace till hee compleat them in glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Only know, That though we thus diſtinguiſh; the Kingdom of God is one and the ſame, and is rather ſo diſtinguiſhed to our capacity, than in the things themſelves: for the ſame acts of government may in divers conſiderations relate to his general and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Kingdom, though the diſtinction may well be retained for our better underſtanding: Now this ſpeciall Kingdom, is either,</p>
               <p>1. Inchoate (if I may uſe that word) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, in this life, commonly called the Kingdom of grace: which conſiſts in thoſe acts of government which God exerciſeth over his elect in this world, by certain means of his owne appointment, as the Miniſtry, Word, Sacraments, conjoyned with the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Spirit, whereby hee converts, and governs them, bringing them on in grace, till hee hath prepared them for glory: in which reſpects ſometimes the Goſpel, Word and Miniſtry, ſometimes the Church militant are figuratively called the Kingdom of God. Or,</p>
               <p>2. Conſummate in the life to come, called the Kingdom of glory, in which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately communicates glory to his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:48822:167"/>
governing them, not by means, as here but by himſelf immediately, and wherein obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not ſo much their work as their wages, and themſelves are not ſo much ſubjects as Kings, partaking with God in endleſs glory and happineſs.</p>
               <p>Now here the Kingdom of God in its whole latitude, both generall and ſpeciall and this both in grace and glory muſt needs be meant; becauſe (as I hinted) they are but one and the ſame, though diverſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Though chiefly, I conceive, the Kingdom of grace, in order to that of glory is here intended: yet even Gods generall Kingdom is not excluded, for each of theſe is ſubordinate to other.</p>
               <p>1. The Kingdom of power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is neceſſary to the founding and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment of the Kingdom of grace: God could not gather a Church to himſelf out of the world, nor preſerve it in, nor deliver it from the evill of the world, if hee had not an overruling hand in the grand affairs thereof: The Church and people of God are diſperſed over the world, and are to be gathered out of all Nations: To this end, the Goſpel is to be preached, and publiſhed, a Miniſtry inſtituted <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſuch is the oppoſition that is in mans nature, to this work, and ſuch the influence of Sathan upon the children of diſobedience, that this could never be effected without the influence of Gods generall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: hee muſt order the great mutations in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48822:168"/>
the world to the gathering and building of his Church, as in that <hi>Deut. 32. 8. when the moſt High devided to the</hi> Nations their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, when hee ſeparated the Sons of Adam, hee ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus it muſt be in this caſe. To this purpoſe preſecuters muſt be cut off, Chriſtian Magiſtrates raiſed up, Kings and Potentates of the world muſt be rebuked for his Prophet's and people's fakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 14. Hee muſt <hi>overturn, overturn, overturn,</hi> One Monarchy muſt<note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 27.</note> ſucceed another, and that again muſt be tranſlated to a third, and that to a 4th. Nation, and all this to make way for <hi>the Stone</hi>

                  <hi>cut out of the Mountain without hands</hi> which muſt break all in pieces: Thus God makes his owne deſign of all men, and Kingdoms, and tranſactions that are in the world, not by policy or an after-game, but by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling the grand affairs of the world, which is his generall Kingdom. So that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is undoubtedly included in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. For the Kingdom of grace there is no doubt but it is here chiefly intended; both in it ſelf, and as a means to the Kingdom of glory. God hath appointed the Means as well as End: Faith, Repentance, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48822:168"/>
new obedience are the condition of our raigning with him in glory <hi>Luk. 15. 5. John</hi> 3. 36. For the effecting of theſe, the Goſpel muſt be preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Nor can the Goſpel effect them without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's efficacious concurrence. Now this (in part at leaſt) is the Kingdom of grace when the word not only runs, but is glorified, when God by his Spirit ſo goes out with his Meſſengers that Sathan fals from heaven as lightning, the works of the Divell are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and poor ſouls reſcued from him, and tranſlated into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God: and that this may be, is undoubtedly the import of this Petition.</p>
               <p>3. Then, for the Kingdom of glory, as being the end and conſummation of both the former, it muſt need be included, ſince hee that wills the means wils the end; nor is it only intended obliquely or by the By, but directly and ultimately, as being the conſummation of mans happineſs: ſo that the coming of the Kingdom of Providence in ſubordination to the Kingdom of Grace, and of this in order to the Kingdom of Glory, and of this again as the End and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of both, is the ſcope and import of this Petition.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Come</hi>]. How can it be ſaid to come in any ſenſe? I Anſwer; Wee are not ſo to underſtand it, as if it ſhould remove or be removed from another place; but, as wee ſay, The Sun comes into the houſe, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not the body but the beams of it; ſo
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48822:169"/>
for the Kingdom of God to come, is, that in its effects and power it be extended to, us, that wee may feel the day of his power, that as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 17. hee would take to him his Kingly power and reign; That hee would ſo order the affairs of the world, as it may appear, and men may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, There is a God that reigneth in the earth, and ſo as may tend to his Churches advantage. What the fuller import of this word is, will be ſhewed in the Application, Now, had wee deſigned a full handling of things, many Obſervations would flow from the particulars coucht' in this Petition: as, That God hath a Kingdom: That this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes to places and people: That to have it come is a deſireable mercy: That prayer is a ſpeciall means for the procuring of it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall (as I promiſed) content my ſelf to reſolve the Petition it ſelf into a Doctrinall Propoſition, which take thus.</p>

For the advantage of it, you will better diſcern it when wee more particularly unfold it in the application: meanwhile conſider but that Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not in meat and drink, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt:</hi> There are three grand benefits accruing from Gods Kingdom, which would afford an ample field of diſcourſe but I forbear: what greater

ſouls, families, towns, and Nation: doe but think (for I ſhall not run into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars), what are the benefits that flow from the moſt prudent and pious adminiſtration of an Earthly Kingdom: thoſe in a larger meaſure will accrue (in a Spiritual ſenſe) from the coming of Gods Kingdom unto you. Infinite and unſpeakable are the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a Government rightly managed, both as to the preventing of evils and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of good things, but none compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Kingdom of God: hence righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, peace, plenty, proſperity, defence, ſafety, unity, and (which reſults from all) unſpeakable joy and comfort. But I leave this to your owne meditation: Study <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. which relates to Chriſt as well as to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and thoſe many propheſies which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and promiſe this Kingdom, and the coming of it; and predicate the exceeding benefits and advantages of it.</p>
               <p>2. Then may you hope it ſhall come to your comfort, when it is the breathing of your ſouls that it may come: 'tis promiſed to the upright that they ſhall <hi>ſee the King in his glory.</hi> Iſa. 33. 17. They that like <hi>Simeon,</hi> wait for the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may ſing his ſong when Chriſt is revealed in the Goſpel <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 25, 29.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48822:171"/>
where it, is 'tis in power and juſtice; where it <hi>comes,</hi> 'tis in love and mercy: it may be amongſt us, and yet leave us in the Sea to ſuffer ſhipwrack: where it <hi>comes,</hi> it brings us to a haven: but (whether there be ground enough for this diſtinction or no) wee may diſtinguiſh of its coming: To ſome, it comes againſt their will, and they wilfully withſtand it as <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 14. To others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their will; and they neglect it, unleſs it pleaſe God to open their eyes to ſee, and incline their hearts to embrace it: but to others, begging and ſeeking after it; and theſe may certainly rejoice, and lift up their heads. As a King's coming to the Throne is matter of fear and terrour to Rebels, but of joy and comfort to truely loyall ſubjects. Though, I muſt needs tell you, that even ſuch deſires and breathings after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, ſpeak that God is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his Kingdom in ſuch ſouls.</p>
               <p>3. 'Tis the ſumme of what wee can or need to ask for our ſelves or others: As what we ask in reference to God is included in, and reducible to the firſt Petition; ſo what for our ſelves to this: As our bleſſed Saviour reduced Gods Ten-words (ſo the Hebrew calls the Ten <hi>Commandments</hi>) to two, and the Apoſtle reduces both to one <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 14. ſo might all the following be reduced to theſe two, and both to this one; for by the powerfull and effectuall coming of Gods Kingdom, in all the branches of it, both the name of God is ſanctified, and wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48822:172"/>
a confluence of all good things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſpirituall, and eternall.

               <p>3. Here wee implicitly acknowledg that all means are ineffectuall for the promoting of Gods Kingdom, till God himſelf take to him his great power and reign, in as much as this Petition is not only to be put up by thoſe who have not the Goſpel (they indeed will not, cannot pray it) but by thoſe eſpecially who have the means whereby God promotes and exerciſes his Kingdom.

So that here we may take occaſion to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify upon the great oppoſition that's made againſt God and his Kingdom; that Sathan with all his might endeavours to keep the world in blindneſs and rebellion; even hee who is the Prince of the power of the air <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2.

               <p>1. Privative: wherein wee deprecate hindrances, that God will ſubdue all his enemies. Now though the oppoſers of Gods Kingdom be infinite, yet they all ſight under one General, and that is <hi>Sathan;</hi> ſo that the thing wee are chiefly to pray againſt is the Kingdom of Sathan; which is indeed a very ample Kingdom, hee being call'd <hi>the God of this world, The Prince of the power of the aire,</hi> and (as <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11.) <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie and power.</hi>—So <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 11. He is the King of that black Armado that

warre againſt the Saints, called <hi>Abaddon Apolliôn.</hi> Wee are therefore to beg that this dragon the old Serpent the Divell and Sathan may be bound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. That hee may fall from heaven as lightning <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 18. that Jeſus Chriſt may ſo come as to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Divell 1 John.</hi> 3. 8. Now this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sathan hath divers branches (as it were ſo many Provinces) or it is founded and upheld ſeverall wayes, hath many pillars; all which wee muſt pray againſt. For inſtance,</p>
               <p>1. His power and influence upon man by reaſon of corrupt nature. Here hee keeps Garriſon <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21. This ſtrong man armed keeps hold in man, and this Hold fortified, hath bulwarks, walls as high as Heaven, hath its <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>high things,</hi> that exalt themſelves againſt the knowledg of Chriſt; by this advantage men are held and led Captive by Sathan at his will &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Now here is an ample field of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pray down the power of corruption, and to begge that wee and others may be reſcued and fnatcht' from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. that the weapons of his Miniſters warfare may be mighty through his power &amp;<hi>c.</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>2. The groſs Errors, Deluſions, Idolatry and Superſtition which raigns in the world, is that whereby Sathan holds a great part of the world under his vaſſalage. Where the true God is not known, the Divell cauſes

'Tis lamentable to read ſome relations of the poor Indians, how the Divell deludes and tyrannizes over them, appearing in viſible ſhapes, and commanding worſhip from them. And what is the Turkiſh <hi>Mahomet</hi> with all his impoſtures, but an Inſtrument rais'd by Sathan to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Kingdom?

               <p>3. The influence that Sathan hath on the great ones of the world; to ſet them in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Gods Kingdom. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.

Becauſe this City for ſuperſtition
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48822:175"/>
and Idolatry exceeded moſt Cities in <hi>Aſia.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Lievetenant or Subſtitute under <hi>Domitian</hi> (Authour of one of the ten Perſecutions) inhabited there, and butchered the poor Saints of God. Surely, where wicked men, enemies to God and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have power, and precedency in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sathan may be ſaid to reign there. Theſe are great Mountains before God's <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabels, Zech.</hi> 4. 7. Whereby doth Sathan more hinder the advancement of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than by intereſſing himſelf in the great Ones of the world, and interweaving his intereſt with theirs? Hath not the ſecular power in almoſt all ages of the Church been engag'd againſt the Goſpel, either as to the preaching, or as to the power and practiſe of it? How, have the moſt faithfull of Gods meſſengers been ſilenced, impriſoned, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſerious and truely pious Chriſtians ſuffered grievous things from the hands of the wicked Magiſtracy? What then? muſt wee pray down Magiſtracy, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, if wicked? Far be it from us? 'Tis Gods Ordinance, they are God's ſubſtitutes; <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought,</hi> Eccl. 10. 20. No but earneſtly pray that they that are great may bee good, that <hi>Kings may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Nurſing-Fathers, and Queens Nurſing-Mothers to the Church,</hi> Iſa. 49. 23. that, as they rule by God <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.—ſo they may rule for him. Pray that prayer for them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>Theſe are three of the grand pillars of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48822:175"/>
Kingdom; for the pulling downe of<note place="margin">Judg. 16. 30.</note> which wee muſt <hi>bow our ſelves with all our night</hi> in prayer, that Gods Kingdom may be erected upon the ruins of Sathans. More might be added, but I proceed.</p>
               <p>2. Poſitive Petitions are here included. And theſe I ſhall reduce to that three-fold Kingdom of God, which I hinted in the explication. <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom, 1. of Power and providence. 2. of Grace. 3. of Glory.</p>
               <p>1. Then in reference to Gods generall Kingdom of power or providence; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (in compliance with this Petition) is to be beg'd: though (as I hinted) this Kingdom is not ſo properly prayed for in it ſelf conſidered as in that it relates to God's ſpeciall Kingdom. So that we muſt pray,</p>
               <p>1. That God will ſo order the great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and tranſactions in the world, as that it may appear, that He is abſolute Lord and Soveraign over the world: that hee will exert his abſolute power and ſoveraignty. Here, though wee muſt beware of charging God fooliſhly, as if hee were unjuſt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent in the managment of the world's government; yet wee may (in imitation of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1.) humbly plead with the Almighty, why; ſeeing hee hath the regiment of the world, the wicked are ſuffered to take root and proſper <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Such a plea you find <hi>Job</hi> 24. 1.—Wee may pray that God will in his owne time make it explicit to all the world, that hee reigns
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48822:176"/>
over the nations, and that there is one God and his name one. And,</p>
               <p>2. That God will ſo manage the affairs of the world, as may tend to the increaſe and happineſs of his Church? that by the Kingdom of his providence, hee will make way for the Kingdom of his grace, and fit men for the Kingdom of glory: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may you plead thoſe promiſes <hi>Pſal. 2. 8. Iſa.</hi> 66. 20.—that the Goſpel may run and be glorified.</p>
               <p>2. In reference to the Kingdom of grace (which I take to be properly meant here), our Petitions, in conformity to this; may reſpect either, 1. The means of it. 2. Or the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of thoſe means: or 3. The amplification and increaſe both of the means, and of the efficacy of thoſe means.</p>
               <p>1. As to the means of promoting this Kingdom, they are many: the principal are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. The pure adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments; which is therefore called <hi>the Kingdom of God, Matth.</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>the word of the Kingdom, Matth. 13. 19. Mark.</hi> 4. 15. becauſe of its ſpeciall tendency to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Gods Kingdom: therefore wee are earneſtly to pray for the ſpreading of the<note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 2.</note> Goſpel: that <hi>light</hi> may ariſe <hi>to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the region of the ſhadow of death:</hi> that <hi>labourers</hi> may <hi>be thruſt out into the harveſt</hi> Matth. 9. 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that hee will not ſuffer them to be thruſt out: that thoſe hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel may have Liberty, Countenance, and Maintenance, that God will give the word, and <hi>great may be the number of thoſe that publiſh it:</hi> &amp;c. This (let men think what they pleaſe) is the way to bring the Kingdom of God into, and promote it in, a Nation: and when Gods faithfull meſſengers are ſuſpended, ſilenced, caſt out; and dumb dogs that cannot bark are ſet over the flocks, then doe a Nation put away the Kingdom of God from them.</p>

of the Kingdom of God, ſets up the power and pride and domination of men. The other extream, is <gap reason="foreign">

I am far from denying the Magiſtrate his juſt power,<note place="margin">See <hi>Jus divinum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giminis Eccleſiaſt.</hi> and the Author of <hi>Engl. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cerem:</hi>
                  </note> and I think (were things duely and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſidered) they that are charged to be moſt niggardly towards the Magiſtrate in ſtating his power about Eccleſiaſtical affairs, would be ſound leaſt guilty; and thoſe that pretend to be moſt liberal, would be found guilty of the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon it (for indeed they but give it with one hand that they may receive it again with the other). Now, did each keep their due ſtation, and in their ſtation proſecute the great ends for which God hath ſet them in thoſe ſtations, it would be an effectuall means to promote the Kingdom of God: whereas theſe Uſurpations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of each upon other, ſet up man to the dethroning God, and hindering the propagation of his Kingdom. I could here break out infinitely, in complaining of the ſad effects of theſe things in Nations and Kingdoms, eſpecially where theſe intruſions and encroachments are mutual; where each gives, that hee may receive, and is bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48822:177"/>
to the other, that hee may have the ſame meaſure back again; Where men thus deal and ſhare power and honour among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God muſt needs ſuffer in his honour and Kingdom; but I had rather you and I ſhould turn in to God, and complain to him, who only can redreſs theſe grievances: this is unqueſtionably a part of the import of this Petition, To pray for a Diſcipline moſt agreeable to the Scripture, and moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conducing to the ends of Diſcipline, ſuch as may put ſin to ſhame, and bring Sinners to repentance; ſuch a Diſciplin as was exerciſed in the primitive and pureſt times, which was then moſt effectuall for its end; when the civill Magiſtrate not only ſtood neuter to it, but was oppoſite againſt it. This would be a ſingular means to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>3. (Which hath been already toucht' up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) A pious Magiſtracy: that Kings and Potentates may caſt their Crowns at Chriſt's feet, and ſet them upon his head. Oh, if the civill powers did (as they ought to doe) ſeriouſly proſecute the Intereſt and honour of God in the world, there would be no need of diſputing that vexed and perplexing Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about the Magiſtrates power in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs: then, as hee would not arrogate what is not due, ſo hee would not abuſe what God hath allowed him. What need then have wee to put in ſuit ſuch promiſes as thoſe <hi>Iſa. 49. 23. Rev. 11. 15. &amp;c.</hi> Then, I conceive, the Kingdoms of the world would be the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48822:178"/>
Kingdoms of the Lord and his Chriſt, when the Kings of the Earth, and the body of the Magiſtracy kiſs the Son, and ſubmit to his Crown and Scepter. Though I can ſee little ground for that which ſome dream of, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall viſible reign of Chriſt on earth; yet this is doubtleſs within the Compaſs of the promiſes, and ſhould be the matter of our prayers, That Chriſt may reign in his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents. Wreſtle then with God that the Magiſtracy of the world may be ſuch as they are deſcribed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. Wee ſhould (like the primitive Church) travel in birth for a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child <hi>i. e.</hi> a truely Chriſtian Magiſtracy, as that Text is commonly interpreted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 2. that they may be ſuch as <hi>David</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be, <hi>Pſam. 101. per tot.</hi> Then would the Kingdom of God come.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond head of Petitions relating to the Kingdom of grace, are ſuch as reſpect the efficacy of thoſe means whereby it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, eſpecially the ſpiritual means: briefly, that God will attend his Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances with his Spirit, that hee will make Doctrine and Diſciplin ſuccesfull for their proper ends, the gathering and edifying of his Church: that men may from the heart <hi>obey the word delivered to them,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. that the <hi>weapons of our warfare may be mighty through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. that not only a wide but effectuall <hi>door may be opened,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 9. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> pray, that it may be the day of Gods power, and his Arm may be revealed.</p>
               <p>3. The third ſort relates to the amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48822:178"/>
and ſpreading of the means, and that in their power; that the Kingdom of God may be both extenſively and intenſively increaſed, and the Goſpel may gain both in heighth and breadth: A precious promiſe (amongſt many other) is that, Iſa. 54. 2. <hi>Lengthen thy cords, and ſtrengthen thy ſtakes:</hi> there's both extenſion and intenſion, and a promiſe it is (though at firſt view it may ſeem a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) as plainly appears by the following Verſes.

                  </gap>cts in profeſſion, may be ſuch in reality; and thoſe that are in reality ſo, may walk more anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Duties and Priviledges. Thus I have touch't upon the Petitions relating to the Kingdom of grace.</p>
               <p>3. As to the Kingdom of glory many things might be mentioned: In ſhort theſe three things more eſpecially.</p>
               <p>1. That God would ſo promote the work of grace in our owne and others hearts, that wee may be fitted for the Kingdom of glory: That wee may come on to perfection, and may in our hopes and preparations <hi>look for and haſten towards the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11.</p>
               <p>2. That hee will compleat the number of his elect: and cauſe the Goſpel to have a ſpeedy paſſage and effect, that for the Elects ſake the dayes may be ſhortened, Nations may be born in a day <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 10. Wee ſhould

               </p>
               <p>3. (Which followes) That hee will haſten the Coming of Chriſt: that wee may obtain full redemption, and may be poſſeſſed of the unfading Crown of glory. This wee may breathe out in the language of <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 5. 2-9. Phil.</hi> 1. 21. or of Saint <hi>John.</hi> Rev. 22. ult. <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Thus I have helped your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as to the matter of this Petition, which is the firſt Direction. The other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the frame of your hearts in praying this Petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Labour to frame your hearts to the Petition, as well as the Petition to the pattern: Ask with a ſuitable frame of Spirit; which chiefly conſiſts in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>1. A heart inflamed with deſire to ſee the King in his beauty: to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habitation, and the praiſe of the whole earth: Your hearts muſt outcry your voices, and your affections be much larger then your expreſſions. And why ſhould wee not be thus inflamed? Is there a more deſireable mercy, if I may call that a mercy which is indeed a confluence of all mercies? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you conſider this Kingdom as to the perſonal and particular advantages it brings to your ſelves and other individual perſons, or the benefits that come along with it to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48822:179"/>
Towns, Nations, and Kingdoms, there is not a more deſireable thing in the world: meditate then on the excellencies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that attend the coming of this Kingdom, till you hearts be inflamed with holy breathings after it; then give vent to thoſe pantings of hearts in prayer; ſuch prayers are highly pleaſing and acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>2. A frame of heart reſolved both to ſubmit to it, and promote it in your capacities: What notorious diſſimulation, and damnable hypocriſy is it, dayly to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come</hi>—; yet ſet our ſelves to oppoſe and hinder the propagation of it? You are deeply guilty of this who live in manifeſt diſobedience to the Goſpel, will not be inſtructed, nor ſubmit to the unqueſtionable power of the Miniſters of the Goſpel: <hi>viz.</hi> to be reproved, admoniſhed, exhorted, by them: you that wallow in ſin, are ſold as Slaves to ſin and Sathan, and will not take Chriſt's eaſy yoak and light burden upon you: With what face can you pray ſuch a Petition as this? How many that are mighty zealous to have this form dayly repeated in Church or Pulpit, and yet are notorious enemies both to this and other Petitions, when it comes to the practiſe of what is here prayed for? For ſhame, never plead for the repetition of this pattern of prayer, while the world may read in your lives a viſible contradiction to each Petition in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:48822:180"/>'Tis worſe then a <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs, thus to deal with Chriſt; to pray that his Kingdom may come, and yet to doe our utmoſt to oppoſe it: either leave praying, or begin to practiſe up to what you pray for, in this Petition, elſe you doe but in effect pray for your owne damnation. This Kingdom will come in juſtice and Terror to all its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers. So much to this Petition.</p>

               <p>THis is the third and laſt of thoſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that do more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God: it is very fitly connected to the former, for having prayed for the coming of his Kingdom, that is, that wee may be brought under his Government, and become his ſubjects, 'tis fit that his will, not ours, ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>Having acknowledg'd him ſupream Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the world, and that all ſubjection is due to him, wee are very fitly taught to pray that hee will ſo bend and bow our hearts and bring us into compliance with his

will, that wee may yield him cheer-full obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as ſubjects, not as ſlaves: and that wee may be a willing people in the day of his power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3.

There is ground enough for ſuch a diſtinction (though not in the Will or effence of God, which is purely ſimple and uncompounded yet) in the wayes by which God declares and executes his Will.

this, Know, that things are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either, 1. Abſolutely, and as to any power, whether finite or infinite: ſo, it is impoſſible for God to lie, for a thing to be and not to be, at the ſame time; for a body to be in two places at once <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ſuch a thing to pray for, would be but a tempting or mocking God: but the thing in the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not impoſſible in this ſenſe.—2. Or in ſome reſpect, as for man in his own ſtrength to obey the Law of God in its exactneſs, but not if God communicate grace proportionable. For <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had this ability, and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> as to his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Now things of this ſort may be both prayed for, and endeavoured after: <hi>Phil. 3. 11.

               <p>Secondly, I conceive the Petition rather reſpects the manner than the meaſure of our obedience, that wee may in our meaſure imitate the holy Angels.

Gods will muſt be done, whether you pray for it or no; but to pray heartily that it may be done is no ſmall evidence of a gracious frame of Spirit: Gods will may be done by us as it was by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> Act. 4. 28. and by <hi>Cyrus</hi> Iſa. 44. 28. yet wee be no better than vile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or brute inſtruments: and it may be done upon us as upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> and others, yet for our puniſhment and condemnation; But condially to deſire and pray in the ſenſe of the Petition, that it may be done by us and upon us, ſpeaks the truth of grace in our hearts. None but they who are <hi>born of the Will of God,</hi> John 1. 13. can cordially and univerſally deſire and pray this Petition. Naturally man may ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> but only the gracious ſoul can unfeignedly pray it.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis moſt irrationall to deſire that our owne or others wills ſhould be done; and moſt equitable, that wee ſhould pray that Gods will may be done: <hi>Should it be as thou wilt, according to thy mind,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job</hi> Chapt. 34. 33? Who are wee poor blind creatures, that wee ſhould ſet our Wills againſt the wiſe and juſt and holy Will of God? Should his will who can will noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48822:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but what is juſt and good, give place to ours, who can will nothing that is good, without his enabling grace? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. How juſt is it, that his will ſhould be our Rule whether wee conſider him as our Creatour, our Soveraign, our Father <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and beſides, ſhould ours be done, would it not be to our undoing (What greater plague, than for a people to be given up to follow their owne counſels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 12? And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is not the doing Gods Will the high road to glory, the ſtraight path to everlaſting felicity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. For Direction then (as in the former): Labour to underſtand the particular import of this Petition, and 1. Underſtand what is implyed by way of acknowledgment: Chiefly two things.</p>
               <p>1. Here is implicitely acknowledged the abſoluteneſs and Soveraignty of Gods Will, which you may (in conformity to this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) expreſs and enlarge upon: So that wee may expreſs our ſelves in ſuch Words: "Lord, I know thou art the Suprem Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and abſolute Soveraign of the world, all whoſt actions have no other rule but thine owne will, and thy Will no rule but thine owne infinite wiſdom, juſtice, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore it is impoſſible thou ſhouldſt will any thing, but what is good and righteous. Therefore it is all the Reaſon in the world, that thou whoſe Dominion is moſt abſolute, and whoſe will is moſt righteous, ſhouldſt be obeyed and ſubmitted
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48822:185"/>
to in whatſoever thou willeſt to be done, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>by</hi> us, or <hi>upon</hi> us. To this purpoſe you may borrow <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5, 9, 11. which declares that God ordereth <hi>all things according to the counſel of his owne will.</hi> Pſal. 136. 6. <hi>who doth what hee pleaſeth in heaven and earth, in the ſea, and in all deep places:</hi> Job 33. 13. who is not accountable for any of his doings. Or in the words of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4. 35. &amp;c. Here you may amplify upon the purity, wiſdom, Soveraignty, goodneſs and graciouſneſs of his Will; as alſo upon the reaſonableneſs of its being the Rule of the Creatures actions and obedience, that the Clay and Veſſel ſhould be at the Potter's diſpoſall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 9.</p>
               <p>2. Here alſo wee doe implicitly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the indiſpoſition and untowardneſs of our wils to yield obedience to Gods Will: and our proneneſs to do our owne will, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Gods; yea, that wee are led Captive by <hi>Sathan</hi> at his Will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. This may afford large matter of confeſſion, and confuſion too. "Lord, I find in my ſelf abundance of blindneſs and ignorance, ſo that I doe not know thy will, and (which is worſe) when it is made known to mee, I find in my heart an utter indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition and contrariety to it: Oh the pride, ſtubbornneſs, and ſtiffeneckedneſs of my heart! How apt am I to quarrel at thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Will when I ſhould obey it; and at thy providencial will, when I ſhould ſubmit to it? Loath I am that thy will ſhould be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48822:186"/>
done when it thwarts mine: This you may expreſs in the language of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Children of diſobedience, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind:</hi> you may borrow the complaint of God againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 48. 4. an obſtinate people, whoſe neck hath an Iron ſinew, whoſe brow is braſs: here you may lament the Fall, that robb'd you of the holy freedom and conformity of your will to Gods, and your hearts became like <hi>Nabal's,</hi> dead as a ſtone, to any thing ſpiritually good. Here you may be very large and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, this being the ſpring of all the ſins and enormities of your lives.</p>
               <p>2. Then labour to underſtand what is included by way of Petition: and theſe are (as before), Either,</p>
               <p>1. Privative, for the removal of hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which keep us from the knowing, obeying and ſubmitting to the will of God, which Alas! how infinite are they? rather to be by you and every perſon beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, than by mee expreſſed: Oh what need have wee to pray that God Will h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. Inwards; ſuch as are from within, and ariſe from a mans ſelf: and theſe are as large as the whole body of ſin, and as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as the members of that body. There is blindneſs in the underſtanding, that wee cannot know, <hi>what is that good, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and perfect will of God,</hi> Rom. 12. 2.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48822:186"/>
therefore wee have need to pray as <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have mee doe?</hi> or as wee are taught <hi>Job</hi> 34. 32. <hi>what I know not, teach thou mee</hi>—Again, there is Obſtinacy in the will, wee have need pray that promiſe <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. That God will <hi>take away our heart of ſtone</hi> &amp;c—There is in us weakneſs and inability to good, though a ſinfull ſtrength to doe evill: There<note place="margin">Eph. 2 3.</note> are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>wils of the fleſh,</hi> which oppoſe the will of God. Wee have need pray that God will make the weapons of his Word and Miniſtry ſtrong and mighty to beat down <hi>thoſe ſtrongholds, thoſe imaginations, and high things in us</hi>—2 Cor. 10. 4. That all within us may yield to Gods will, that wee may lay downe our weapons, and take upon us the yoak of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>2. Outward, <hi>viz.</hi> that Slavery which wee are in to Sathan, who hath <hi>blinded our eyes,</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 4. 4. <hi>Captivated ours wils</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. and <hi>fill'd our hearts,</hi> Act. 5. 3. <hi>working effectually in us the children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2. Therefore wee have need to pray that Jeſus Chriſt may come into our hearts there to deſtroy the works of the Divell. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. That the ſtronger man may come and diſpoſſeſs this <hi>ſtrong man armed</hi> Luk. 11. 21, 22. May ſnatch us from the <hi>power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> Col. 1. 13. That wee being delivered from the hands of this and all our enemies, may ſerve the Lord in holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before him all the dayes of our life <hi>Euk.</hi> 1. 74.

               <p>2. Poſitive: and thoſe may refer to that two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Will (or rather two-fold conception of the will) of God I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>1. In reference to the Will of Purpoſe, (which I told you was neither wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of this Petition, nor in its whole latitude included in it) two things are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be begged.</p>
               <p>1. That God will bring about his great and generall decrees concerning his owne glory and mans ſalvation, in his owne time and way: ſince hee hath reveald that hee will have a Church, that hee hath cloſen a number out of the world which in time hee will gather to himſelf, that wee may and ought to pray, that hee will bleſs the means in order to the gathering his Church, and compleating the number of his ſanctified ones: In a word (for I might here be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in particulars) all thoſe gracious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes concerning the gathering, governing, defending, delivering, and ſaving his Church, which God hath in his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by way of declaration or promiſe, may and ought to be the matter of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, For (I think I may ſafely ſay) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prayer's walk is as large as the whole compaſs of the promiſes. Only wee muſt here be cautious that wee doe not tie up God to the fulfilling his purpoſes, and promiſes, in a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48822:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time, place or way wherein hee hath not bound himſelf to fulfill them. Wee muſt leave God as looſe as hee hath left himſelf, and not add to his words leſt wee be found lyars, or leſt wee be tempted to charge God as a lyar. For Scripture-expreſſion, the 2d. 72d. and 87d. Pſalmes, and many other places, will abundantly furniſh you.</p>
               <p>2. That when Gods decrees and purpoſes are fulfilled upon us or others, they and wee may be taught ſubmiſſion and thankfulneſs; may learn old <hi>Eli</hi>'s frame 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. or <hi>Aaron</hi>'s. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 16. 3. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s 2 King. 20. 19. or thoſe <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 14. for which wee may pray in their language, <hi>viz.</hi> that wee may be enabled to ſay from our ſouls in the darkeſt and ſaddeſt providence, as they did, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him doe what ſeemeth good in his ſight,</hi> or, <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> or, as <hi>Aaron</hi> there, may <hi>hold our peace.</hi> This is the proper Petition in reference to the Will of <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> and this indeed reſpects it in its whole latitude (at leaſt ſo far as it any way relates to us): for though many things may come within the purpoſe of God, the fulfilling of which it may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to pray for; yet it concerns us to pray for a ſuitable deportment under them when fulfill'd: That wee may be ſilent with <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 39. 9. That wee may bleſs the Lord with <hi>Job</hi> Chapt. 1. 21. under Gods more ſevere diſpenſation; That wee may neither <hi>deſpiſe the chaſtning of the Lord nor be weary of his correction</hi> Hebr. 12. 5. but may

ſubmit our ſelves cordially, cheerfully, univerſally under the mighty hand of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. And then, on the other hand, when Gods gracious purpoſes are fulfilled upon us, or concerning our ſelves and others, wee ſhould pray that they and wee may be enabled to make a thankfull acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anſwerable improvement. So that wee may to this purpoſe expreſs our ſelves; "Lord, I know not what is in the womb of thy decrees concerning my ſelf or others, only that whatever thou haſt purpoſed it ſhall in the execution of it, be juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and I hope good and gracious: whatever it is, Lord, teach us a right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, let not mee or others lay Croſs to thy will in any providence; make us willing that thou ſhouldſt have thy will upon us though it may Croſs ours: Let us ſee ſo much of Soveraignty, equity, juſtice, yea mercy and goodneſs in thy will, as may teach us to lay our hand upon our mouths, and where wee cannot apprehend to admire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lay down our Wils at thy feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe two things, I conceive, conſiſts the ſumme of what wee are to pray for in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>2. But that which is more eſpecially our concernment as to this Petition, is to pray for grace and abilitie to doe the commanding Will of God: in reference to which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the hindrances to be deprecated (which are partly the ſame as in the former Petitions, our requeſts may reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:48822:188"/>1. The helps, and enablements neceſſary to the doing of Gods Commands; amongſt many theſe two principally.</p>
               <p>1. Underſtanding and knowledg, without which it is impoſſible to doe them aright, borrow <hi>Davids</hi> words. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 18, 34, 73, 125, 144. Pray as <hi>Paul</hi> for his <hi>Epheſians</hi> Chapt. 1. 17, 18. and 5. 17. that you may not be <hi>unwiſe but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi> Blindfold obedience cannot be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>2. That God will work your hearts, and your whole man into an obediential frame, by taking away <hi>the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and giving you a heart of fleſh:</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. that hee will <hi>ſtrengthen you with might in the inner man.</hi> Eph. 3. 16. that our hearts may be ſo enlarg'd, that wee may <hi>run the way of his commandements,</hi> and ſo inclined that wee may <hi>keep his Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119. 32, 36. that wee may ſee ſo much equity, taſt ſo much ſweetneſs in his commands as may draw out our hearts to a cheerfull obedience: that the Word may not only be delivered to us, but wee may be <hi>delivered up to it</hi> ſo as to <hi>obey it from the heart</hi> Rom. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. That though there may be many commands above our ſtrength, yet there may be none againſt our will, to do: To this end we may plead the promiſes of the Covenant of grace ſuch as <hi>Jer. 32. 40. and 31. 33.

               <p>1. <hi>Freely</hi> and cheerfully without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which reſpect the Angels are ſaid <hi>alwayes to behold the face of God,</hi> Matth. 18. 10. that is, to ſtand wayting for their errand. Pray we for the like frame. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Speedily</hi> without delay: therefore wings are aſcribed to them: What a ſpeedy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch did one Angel make in <hi>Sennacherib's.</hi> Army in one night 185000. Pray that wee may doe ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 60.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Humbly</hi> without diſputing: If <hi>Michael</hi> durſt not bring a railing accuſation againſt the Divell when hee diſputed with him about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> much leſs dare they diſpute the Commands of God.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> It is worth our enquiry, Why this Petition for temporals, is put before thoſe for ſpirituals, ſince wee are commanded to <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Matth. 6. 33?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It might be replyed that in the three firſt Petitions wee have ſought the Kingdom of God—. For though thoſe Petitions have a more ſpeciall reſpect to God, yet ſo as that our chief-good is intwiſted therein together with Gods glory. But.</p>
               <p>2. That command of <hi>ſeeking fieſt the Kingdom of God</hi> (as hath been hinted) doth not ſo much enjoyne the order of the Petition (or other wayes of ſeeking) as the ardour of affection. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that is, chiefly, principally, with the greateſt intenſeneſs of deſire, and induſtry. Beſides,</p>
               <p>3. It is ſometimes the manner of Scripture to diſpatch that firſt which is of the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: And,</p>
               <p>4. Outward things of neceſſity to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our beings are requiſite in order to ſpirituals: the ſoul while in conjunction with the body needs the body's help as its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and the body in order to this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs muſt have neceſſary ſupports of food and rayment: it is exceeding clamorous, and will be attended; the neceſſities of nature muſt be ſupplied, elſe it will hinder the ſoul's operations.

                  </note> God out of his indulgence to us, to allow us the ſeeking of theſe things next thoſe that concern himſelf; that theſe being layd in, wee may with more cheerfulneſs attend the ſervice of himſelf and of our ſouls. As our Saviour cured corporal infirmities to draw men to look to him for the cure of ſpirituall. By this means outward things are

               <p>[<hi>This day</hi>] It hath been ſuppoſed by ſome that two diſtinct things are asked in this Petition <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Life it ſelf in thoſe words [<hi>This day</hi>] 2. The things of this life, [<hi>our dayly bread</hi>] though I will not deny the Truth of the thing <hi>viz.</hi> that life as well as the things of this life, is asked; yet I ſee no reaſon ſo to parcell the words; and hee that looks into the <hi>Greek</hi> Text will eaſily ſee that it cannot bee: for they run in this order. <hi>Give us our dayly</hi> (or neceſſary) <hi>bread this day: i. e.</hi> for this day: ſo that it is (as I have hinted) a limitation of this Petition as to the time for which wee ask it.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Our</hi>]. Bread is called ours, not that God owes it us, but becauſe by his bounty it is appointed and deſtinated for us, beſides [<hi>Our</hi>] that is, that which wee come by in a way of induſtry, or at leaſt in a lawfull way: according to that 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 12. eat their [Owne] bread: i. e.</hi> gotten by their lawfull labour and diligence: So that this gives us a hint of that law, <hi>Gen. 3. 19.

With what limitations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why are temporall things or neceſſaries for this life to be ſought, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? A Reaſon or two ſhall ſufficice.</p>

That hereby wee may acknowledg that both the having, and comfort in the having, of outward things, depends upon Gods bounty and bleſſing: that we neither have any right and title to them without Gods leave, nor can taſt any ſweetneſs or comfort in them, without his love: all our benefits are of Gods bounty: <hi>of him,</hi> as well as <hi>through him, and for him are all things.</hi> Rom. 11. 36.

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What are the limitations with when wee muſt ask outward things? Theſe are partly hinted in the very Petition, yet give mee leave more particularly to ſingle them out. It is therefore required,</p>
               <p>1. That wee ask them only ſo far as they may be ſubordinate to the things beg'd in the former Petitions (this I gather from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Petition). So that the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods glory, the coming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the doing of his will, muſt be out ſquare and meaſure in deſiring and asking theſe things. This condition ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes implyed, and, occaſionally, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our prayers for Outwards. This is the ſenſe of <hi>Agur</hi>'s prayer <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. as if hee ſhould ſay, Lord, proportion my outward eſtate in ſuch a meaſure as may
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48822:193"/>
render mee more prompt and ready to glorify thee, and obey thy Commands.</p>
               <p>2. That wee ask them in few words: Chriſt hath taught brevity, both in that hee comprized them all in one Petition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them all to one word <hi>viz. Bread;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating to us that wee ſhould not be ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in them as in ſpiritualls: As to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things the more particular, the better; but in theſe temporal we ſhould not extend our prayers beyond thoſe few neceſſaries here implied under one word <hi>bread,</hi> and by the Apoſtle in two words <hi>food and rayment:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8. However, if our neceſſities or afflictions be ſuch as may draw out larger prayers or complaints, yet wee muſt keep our affections within their due limits; ſo much this Petition teaches:</p>
               <p>3. That they be not more than neceſſaries we aske: 'Tis bread, not dainties, not varieties, not ſuperfluities, wee are taught to ask. Bread being of all externals moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the moſt common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary food. But here wee may conſider a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold neceſſity, or meaſure of neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>1. As to our Being, and to the very ſupport of our life, ſo the meaſure is alike to all, that is, ſo much as may ſatisfy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſo much as may conveniently nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us, ſignified by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>2. As to our condition, and the Station wherein God hath ſet us, and ſo that which may be ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

a Magiſtrate, or one upon whom many have dependance, more may be neceſſary both as to the maintaining of his dependants, and himſelf, according to that ſtate or condition, wherein God hath ſet him. Only his wee muſt beware, whatever our condition be, that wee neither through waſtfulneſs make, nor through inſatiableneſs or wantonneſs eſteem that, to be neceſſary which indeed is not.</p>
               <p>4. That wee ask them not peremptorily, but with ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, that's the limitation in begging the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evils, or the beſtowing of good things relating to this life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 39. 42. <hi>Nevertheleſs, not as I will but as thou wilt:</hi> and it is intimated in the connex on of this with the former Petition: <hi>If the Lord will</hi> muſt be the guide of all our deſigns, and the limitation of all our deſires: <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
               <p>5. That wee ask them not with a ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous<note place="margin">The Arab Verſion is corrupt, <hi>Panem cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiaum da nobis bodie.</hi>

He that deſerves nothing, and worſe than nothing, ſhould be thankfull for every thing. Remember, wee have forfeited all, 'tis indulgence if any thing be given us, 'tis but juſtice if wee be-denyed in what wee ask: God is debtour to none, and therefore all hee gives is of his bounty; but wee lie open to his juſtice, and therefore all hee gives us is both of bounty and merey: Be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore peremptory with God, claime not any thing, diſclaim thine owne worthineſs of any thing; learn ſo to ask, that, if the thing be granted, thou mayeſt aſcribe all to mercy; if denyed, thou mayſt ſubſcribe to Juſtice.</p>

               <p>2.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48822:200"/>
here, in calling ſins a debt, is a Metalepſis or Complication of Tropes. For here is 1. a <hi>Metaphor</hi> borrowed from one that owes money, or any other thing: 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why is forgiveneſs to be ſought by prayer? Reaſons might be multiplyed, Take two of many.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Pſal. 32. 4. there <hi>David</hi> declares his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that when hee purpoſed to confeſs his tranſgreſſion, God forgave the iniquity of his ſin, and then Verſe 5. <hi>For this every one that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48822:203"/>
is Godly ſhall pray unto thee</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> This my experience, ſhall be others encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and what lower terms can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, ſhould God condeſcend to? Should not a Rebell before hee be taken into favour, humble himſelf in the acknowledgment of his fault, <hi>and beg pardon?</hi> Now upon this condition (next to faith in Chriſt) God hath promiſed forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>2. Prayer is the generall Condition of obtaining that and every other mercy: and this is one of the ſpeciall mercies of God; therefore to be ſought in this way: The rule <hi>is, If any man lack, let him ask,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. Now, forgiveneſs is the firſt mercy in the Goſpel-Covenant, and that without which nothing elſe can be mercy. This turns all into mercy, or takes away the ſting of every affliction, <hi>Iſa. 33. ult. The Inhabitants of Sion ſhall ſay I am not ſick, the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity:</hi> the import may be this; being forgiven their iniquity, ſickneſs ſhall not be ſickneſs to them; they ſhall be in a manner inſenſible of it, ſo that ſin being the grand evill, the guilt the ſaddeſt burden, and conſequently pardon the greateſt mercy, at leaſt the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, 'tis fit we ſhould ſeek that in the ſame way as wee doe all other mercies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But why is the condition of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving others urged, rather than any other? 'Tis certain, that faith and repentance are neceſſary conditions in order to pardon, why
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48822:203"/>
then is it not, As wee beleeve or, as wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Our anſwers here, can be but probable, Take two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thoſe conditions doubtleſs are included, though they are not expreſſed. As for Faith, that is a previous condition to the acceptable performance of any duty <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. and more peculiarly requiſite in prayer <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 7. So that this condition of beleeving in order to remiſſion, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently implyed, in that we are taught to ſeek it by prayer, ſince every prayer muſt be the putting in ſuit of ſome promiſe, and no promiſe can be pleaded aright without faith exerciſed in it, the very asking then doth import Beleeving: and for Repentance that's included in the implicite confeſſion of ſin made in this Petition; ſince confeſſing and forſaking (which are the ſumme of true Repentance) muſt goe together in that ſoul that hopes to find mercy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. Theſe conditions therfore are included as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious qualifications in him that begs pardon: beſides that, they, being means in order to forgiveneſs as their end, are together with it, included in the Petition, according to the third of thoſe propoſitions I layd downe before I came to ſpeak to the Petitions in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Why this of forgiveing others is expreſſed, rather than any other; The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reaſon may be.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe of the ſuitableneſs of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the thing Petitioned for, wee ask
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48822:204"/>
forgiveneſs, and plead our owne forgiving others, ſo that herein wee deſire a kind of retaliation, which is alwayes thought the higheſt equity: By asking it upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wee begge to be dealt with, as wee our ſelves deal with others, that if wee ſhew no mercy, wee may find none.</p>
               <p>2. And this poſſibly may be a more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Hoc mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do voluit Chriſtus abſolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis noſtrae ſiduciam quaſi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs ratam facere, <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </note> evidence of our faith and repentance, which in themſelves are not ſo diſcernable, and therefore not ſo pleadable: Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are more hidden things: 'tis eaſy for a man to deceive himſelf and others about them (though I would not be underſtood as if I thought it impoſſible for a man to be certain hee hath them without immediate revelation) but this is eaſily diſcernable both to our ſelves and others: wee can obſerve whether our hearts ſwell with rancour and revengefulneſs, or whether they melt into love and reconcileableneſs, and for the act of forgiveing, others can judge. Now this I may ſay, Where there is a frame of heart prone to forgive injuries upon right grounds (principally upon the ſenſe of the ſoul's greater injury done to God, and its greater need of forgiveneſs at his hands, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath forgiven it) there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly both Faith and Repentance: for true grace is concatenate; ſuch a frame ſpeakes the man renewed (naturally wee are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13. hatefull and hating one another</hi> Tit. 3. 3. <hi>malicious and revengefull</hi>). And where there is a renewing work, it

paſſes over the whole man, the new man hath all his members, every grace, though not in the ſame meaſure: ſo that our forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others being in it ſelf more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, and (where it is indeed) being demonſtrative of the preſence of Faith and Repentance in the ſoul, may be poſſibly put as the condition, or argument in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but certainly it muſt be underſtood as in Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. Something is implied by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, principally, three things.</p>
               <p>1. Here is a cleer acknowledgment that you are Sinners, and ſtand indebted to the Law and Juſtice of God: in conformity therefore to this Petition you are to confeſs ſins, not only in the generall but particularly, in the ſeverall Kinds, circumſtances and aggravations of them: To which purpoſe you may borrow expreſſions from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of the Saints in Scripture,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48822:206"/>
who have leſt their confeſſions upon record, ſuch as, <hi>Pſal. 40. 12. 51.—Ezr. 6. Neh. 9. &amp;c.</hi> This is a Theme frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on: and the manner how ſin is to be confeſſed is fully taught by others, only to give a touch upon it: our confeſſions muſt be, as much as poſſible,</p>
               <p>1. Both univerſal, of all ſin, ſo far as we know it; and particular, of every ſin in its nature and circumſtances.</p>
               <p>2. Cordiall and affectionate, attended, with a ſerious ſenſe of the hainouſneſs of ſin and with ſhame, grief, ſelf-abhorrency, and deteſtation of the fact:</p>
               <p>3. Self judging and ſelf-condemning: we are to paſs a ſentence of death upon our ſelves, that Hell is our due, and everlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might juſtly be out portion. Much more might be added. But,</p>
               <p>2. Here wee are taught to acknowledg that we are non-ſolvent, that wee are in an utter incapacity for the payment of this debt. Were it poſſible to be paid by us, wee ſhould never have been taught to ask forgiveneſs: wee muſt ſue for it, <hi>in form â pauperis,</hi> as being unable to ſatisfy. We are never in a right capacity to ask or obtain forgiveneſs till wee are under a clear conviction of the impoſſibility of our making ſatisfaction.

If hee (i. e.</hi> God) <hi>will contend with him</hi> (man) <hi>hee cannot anſwer him one of a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and: i. e.</hi> hee can neither juſtify himſelf from his ſin, nor ſatisfy for it: In <hi>David</hi>'s

Each condition hath its temptations, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. we have need therefore to fear and pray againſt them; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> were enſnar'd by proſperity <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then, how ſuitably this is ſubjoyned to the foregoing Petition, is eaſily diſcernable; for what good will pardon of ſin paſt do us, without power againſt it for the future? how ſoon ſhall we run upon a new ſcore? when God hath ſaid to the pardoned ſoul (as to the impotent man <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. when cured) <hi>Go thy way, ſin no more leſt a worſe thing come unto thee,</hi> what need have we to pray for grace that we may not return to our vomit, that we may be kept back from preſumptuous ſins?</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how neceſſary this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is as a ſupplement to all the former.</p>
               <p>2. We are therefore to ſeek this mercy at Gods hand by prayer, becauſe, who ever the Inſtrument be, whether man, or Divel, or our own hearts that manage the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt us, God is the ſuprem orderer of it: he lets out or reſtrains, he enables us to conquer or ſuffers us to be conquered, no temptation befals us, but for the kind, manner, time, and all other circumſtances it is diſpoſed by God: The Divel could not tempt <hi>Job, David</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> without Gods permiſſion or commiſſion, not could he overcome any if God did not in Juſtice leave them in his power. To whom therefore ſhould we addreſs our ſelves in this caſe but to that God who is both able and merciful and faithful? He hath the key of mans heart, and can ſo ſhut and fortify it, that the Divel with all his batteries or flatteries, can make no entrie or impreſſion: Nothing in this caſe can be done without his permiſſion and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

he never was, nor ſhall be tempted, is under the ſaddeſt temptation: Such a ſoul (like the men of <hi>Laiſh Judg.</hi> 18. 7.) dwels careleſs, quiet, and ſecure, and lies open to invaſion and deſtruction. To pray againſt temptations is not to pray againſt a thing that poſſibly or probably may come, but certainly will come; nay, if thou art an experienced watchful Chriſtian, I doubt not but thou wilt acknowledg that thou art at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with dayly and hourly temptations; What need then, conſidering thy weakneſs, and corrupt inclinations, dayly to pray this Petition?</p>
               <p>2. Then thy temptations become thy ſins when they are not heartily and earneſtly prayed againſt.

We are alwayes, as it were, in the City, that is, within the reach of God; He is alwayes within hearing, Who is our City of refuge; therefore, our not crying for help will be an interpretative willingneſs to be overcome by the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Nor only when we are actually tempted, but at all times it is needful to pray this Petition; we are never out of harmes way, and commonly never nearer a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than when we think our ſelves

There is no time when our enemies are at reſt, and therefore we ſhould give God no reſt, but be dayly committing our ſelves to his care and cuſtody: That temptation is either not at all thy ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, if thine, nothing ſo hainous, againſt which thou haſt importuned Gods aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>3.

Here we may take up <hi>David</hi>'s words <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. <hi>Innumerable evils compaſs me about:</hi> and many of thoſe paſſages which he uſes in reference to his enemies, we may ſpiritually apply hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis eaſy to amplify, in reckoning up the ſeveral ſorts of temptations wherewith our ſelves and others have been aſſaulted, or lie open to, and the great danger we are continually expoſed to; and if Chriſt himſelf was aſſaulted we have no reaſon to expect freedom from them.</p>
               <p>2. That God may juſtly leave us to be overcome by them, to fall into, and fall by them: that we have that in us for which God may juſtly give us up, as he did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. That, of our ſelves, we are both una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unwilling to reſiſt temptation: we may ſay as <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>We have no power againſt this great multitude:</hi> that our hearts are like tinder, flax, or powder, very fit and combuſtible matter
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48822:217"/>
for <hi>Sathan</hi>'s fiery temptations to take hold on; that our earnal minds are ſo ſtrongly inelined, our wills ſo violent and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, that the leaſt ſpark is enough to ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature: how infinitely may we enlarge here! bewayling that we are ſo wiſe to do evil, ſo eaſily drawn by Sathan, our hearts ſo receptive of his impreſſions; and that when we have once ſuffered our ſelves to be captivated, and our eyes put out, we are ſo far from being able to deliver our ſelves, that we are not willing to be delivered; but rather chooſe to have our eare boared and nayled to Sathans dore, and continue his vaſſails.</p>
               <p>4. That the ordering of all Temptations is in Gods hand; that it is in his power to deliver us from, ſupport us under, and carry us thorow, every temptation: which we may alluſively expreſs in the words of <hi>Aſa</hi> 2 Chron. 14. 11. acknowledging him <hi>the God of Salvations, to whom belong the iſſues from Death,</hi> Pſal. 68. 20. He having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>tread Sathan under our feet</hi> Rom. 16. 20. So that though we have not only <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> to encounter, <hi>but principalities, and powers, the rulers of the darkneſs</hi> of this world, and ſpiritual <hi>wickedneſſes in high places,</hi> yet he is far above them in power, having the Divels in a chain, at his beck <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That though none can deliver out of his hand, yet he can deliver us out of any other's hand whatſoever.</p>
               <p>2. The Petitions included (at leaſt the

principal of them) take in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>1 In conformity to this Petition, we may pray that (ſo far as it may conſiſt with the will and wiſdom of God, and with our ſpiritual and eternal good) he will keep us from temptations, eſpecially of Puniſhment and Seduction: this we may pray with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the import of that (ſo often mentioned) Petition of <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30. 8, 9. And what he prayes as to the extreams of riches and poverty, we may apply to other like caſes: as for inſtance: Let me neither have that fulneſs of joy, that may make me wanton, or neglective of duty; nor let me want thoſe neceſſary ſupports and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which may carry me through the many difficulties and diſcouragements, which I am to encounter in my paſſage through the world. We may pray that God will ſo order his providences, ſo diſpenſe or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his bleſſings, as may leaſt tend to draw out our corruptions. This is much of that which is meant by <hi>leading into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, viz.</hi> ſo ordering his diſpoſals of us, and diſpenſations to us, as that thereby fuel is adminiſtred to our corruptions; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may pray againſt.</p>

                  </hi> that he will ſo reſtrain our enemies, and ſo ſtrengthen and ſortify us, that we may have cauſe to take up that gratulatory Pſalm <hi>viz.</hi> 124th. that, though Sathan or his Inſtruments may be permitted to make attempts upon us, as <hi>Senacherib</hi> againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> and the <hi>Syrians</hi> againſt <hi>Samaria;</hi> yet they may have a hook put in their noſthrils, and return with ſhame and diſappointment: in a word; That the <hi>wicked one</hi> may <hi>not touch us</hi> in the ſenſe of that Text 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. that is <hi>Letaliter,</hi> with a deadly touch, or as ſome [<hi>tactu qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litativo</hi>] with ſuch a touch as may leave an impreſſion of his owne diveliſh Spirit upon us; ſuch a touch as the needle hath from the Loadſtone.</p>
               <p>3. That he will not withdraw from us in our tryals and conflicts; that, if he call us to fight, he will ſtand by and encourage us: To be led into temptation is no great matter, if we be not left in it; and indeed we are never to purpoſe led into it, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48822:219"/>
be ſufficient for us: Though we cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and abſolutely pray for Victory over every temptation, ſince we neither know what God hath decreed, nor how far, a foil for a time may advantage us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>4. That he will keep us from running our ſelves into temptations: this is both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it ſelf, and doubtleſs implyed in this Petition: though there were no outward Tempter, no World or Devil, yet our owne hearts would be, and indeed are, our worſt Tempters, in many caſes our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are home-born, though nurſed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: for Inſtance, when troubles ariſe for the profeſſion of the Truth, and we cannot owne ſome Truth of God but we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to hardſhips and ſufferings; how do men act the part of the Tempter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves? how do our carnal hearts beſpeak us in the language of <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf, this ſhall not be unto thee?</hi> What diſtinctions and evaſions do we ſtudy, to eſcape ſuffering? While we ſhould be ſtudying duty and preparing for danger, we are ſtudying to eſcape the latter, by declining and ſhaking off the former; Like <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he foreſaw that he was ſent upon a troubleſome and dangerous embaſſy, he out-runs the work to avoid the trouble: Pray then that we may not be left to our ſelves as the <hi>Jews</hi> Pſam. 81. 11. Then we ſhall be ſure to be our owne Tempters.</p>
               <p>5. That in thoſe temptations of probation
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48822:219"/>
which himſelf pleaſes to excerciſe us withal, he will enable us to carry as Chriſtians: ſhewing forth our graces, that we may (like <hi>Abraham</hi>) if tryed, by faith offer up our <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Hebr. 11. 15. that our patience may ſhine as <hi>Job</hi>'s did through the clouds of temptation and affliction; that we may <hi>not ſin with our mouths or charge God fooliſhly.</hi> How ſhamefully do we miſcarry when God leaves us, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> how ſhall we diſhonour God, blemiſh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, cauſe the enemy to blaſpheme through our miſdemeanors; if the Lord, who layes the tryal upon us, do not ſtand by us in it, and teach us how to carry under it? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray, Lord if thou will prove us, help us that we may approve our ſelves: If thou wilt excerciſe us with Temptations, fortify us with grace, that the iſſue of the tryal may be thy glory, and our comfort: If thou try us by proſperity, keep us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and obedient; if by adverſity, keep us from deſpondency, indirect actings, theft, maligning others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That, if in his infinite wiſdom he ſee it good at any time to ſuffer us to be foyled, and leave us to our owne weakneſs for our humiliation, or for other good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends; he will not leave us wholly and finally, that it may be with us as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed of <hi>Gad</hi> Gen. 49. 19. <hi>A troop ſhall overcome him, but he ſhall overcome at laſt:</hi> That though he chaſten us, he will not give us over to death, but at laſt <hi>reſtore to us the

joy of his Salvation, and ſtabliſh us with his free Spirit:</hi> That, with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> we may at laſt be avenged of our enemies: that though we fall yet we may not be utterly caſt down, but may be at laſt more then conquerours through him that loved us, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us.</p>
               <p>7. That in ſtead of thoſe things which may proove ſnares and temptations to us, hee would ſo order all his diſpenſations to us as they may incite us to holyneſs, this is the contrary implyed in this Petition: <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord, in ſtead of Sathan ſtanding at my right hand to tempt me, let me have thy good Spirit alwayes egging and urging me to that which is good; in ſtead of the wicked enticeing or diſcouraging me, let me have thy Saints, by their friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, counſels, exhortations and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, provoking me to holyneſs, <hi>let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, and let him reproove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl which ſhall not break my head</hi> Pſal. 141. 5. In ſtead of that meaſure of outwards which may be a ſnare, let me have that which ſhall be a ſpur to piety: In a word, Let me have ſuch Ordinances, ſuch providences, let me be in ſuch company, in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo order all things about me, that thy work within me may go on with power, and all things may concurre and (according to that great promiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.) <hi>work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for my good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. That he will appoint a good iſſue of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48822:220"/>
all temptations that befal us according to that promiſe 1 Cor. 10. 13. that <hi>he will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that we way be able to bear it,</hi> that he will ſo limit our temptations, as to meaſure and continuance, that we be not tempted more or longer than is for our good, and ſo iſſue them at laſt that we may come out as <hi>Job,</hi> and we may have double at our latter end (as to grace and comfort) to what we had at the beginning; and that at laſt he will ſo deliver us from them, as that we may be ſet out of the reach of them, being tranſlated into that ſtate where Sathan ſhall not be able to tempt us any more: this is the higheſt round of this ladder, and then both parts of the Petition ſhall be fulfilled; then ſhall we be fully delivered from all evil, and ſhall ſoon forget all our ſad conflicts, all our tears, and ſighs, and earneſt cries in the dayes of our fears and temptations, when we have once the Crown of glory ſet upon our heads, and the Palms of Victory put into our hands.</p>

when we pray <hi>Lead us not</hi>—and yet wilfully throw our ſelves into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither have we a promiſe, or ſcarce a preſident of any preſerved from temptations, which through their own negligence or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs they have run upon: 'Tis a good obſervation of one upon that <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 40. <hi>Save our ſelves</hi>—That God will not ſave thoſe, that do not endeavour to ſave themſelves. Practiſe up therefore to this Petition; never think or expect that God will give you ſuch a preſervative that ſhall ſecure you from the poyſon of temptation, though you run into any infected and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Aire or Company: the precept is, <hi>Watch,</hi> as well as <hi>Pray that you enter not into temptation,</hi> Luk. 22. 40. 'Tis in vain to disjoin theſe duties which God hath united: prayer without watching is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and watching without prayer is ſelf-confidence. Happy and ſafe is that ſoul that ſincerely practiſeth them in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; we muſt as cautelouſly ſhun occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as if all lay upon our care, and yet as earneſtly pray for preſervation, as if all our endeavours were (as indeed they are) nothing at all: Then may we hopefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we ſhall he kept from temptation, when in our utmoſt endeavours to keep our ſelves we intruſt our ſelves in Gods hand, and commit our ſelves to his keeping: With ſuch a frame therefore, muſt we come to God.</p>

And (which is common to all the reſt of the Petitions, and therefore I would have you ſubjoin it to each, though I only name it here) with a frame of ſpirit full of hearty deſires towards others: As we ſhould go to God as a common Father, ſo our prayers ſhould be common prayers; others as well as our ſelves ſhould be intereſſed in what we pray for, according to their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but of this the Preface gave us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak. Thus I have done with the body of this compleat pattern of prayer: there remains only the concluſion, which I ſhall briefly touch upon as having already performed what I mainly intended.</p>

                  <hi>Kingdom:</hi> this was explained before.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe things might have been ſpoken to at large; but I have rather choſen to give this light touch upon them, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't what I mainly intended in ſpeaking to the Petitions; I ſhall commend you, with theſe poor labours, to the bleſſing of God: only let me begg of you that my pains may not be fruſtrate by your caſting behind your back the things that have been delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my deſign was to help thoſe who neglect the duty of prayer (eſpecially in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies) upon pretence of their want of gifts and abilities; let but ſuch make uſe of thoſe helps, I have here propoſed, and begin to comment upon this excellent pattern, and the ſeveral Petitions (to which purpoſe I have hinted Scripture-phraſe and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and I doubt not but they ſhall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees experience their abilities growing, and indeed I know not a better way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Gift of prayer: But then take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>The Obſervations deducible from the Connexion, Scope, and matter of the Lord's Prayer, had it been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that way of Expoſition which is now in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. GOd's foreknowledge of what we want, is no <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to our asking. Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 8. with 9. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Prayer is a duty befitting all ranks and degrees of Chriſtians. The Multitude, The Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 1. are taught it.</p>
               <p>3. We have need to be taught, and taught again, how to perform the Duty of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as we ought: for though Chriſt here
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48822:228"/>
teach his Diſciples; yet <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1, 2. they deſire to be taught again.</p>
               <p>4. Under ignorance and inability for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Chriſt is both able and ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, and therefore we ſhould beg of him. The Apoſtle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 1, 2. finds Chriſt as ready to teach, as he to deſire it.</p>
               <p>5. It is no diſparagement to be urged to what's good from the example of an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. Chriſt takes it not ill that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples urge him with <hi>John</hi>'s example who was but his forerunner. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p>6. Jeſus Chriſt in teaching his Diſciples, did not ſo much intend to furniſh them with words, as to inſtruct them in the matter of Prayer. <hi>Non jubet Chriſtus ſuos conceptis verbis orare &amp;c. Calvin.</hi> This is plain from the variety of expreſſion in the Two Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>7. Succinct and comprehenſive Methods and Epitome's are an excellent way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For, this is here the Method of the beſt of Teachers, and this commends Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing.</p>
               <p>8. The Spirits inward teaching excludes not verbal and miniſterial Inſtruction. For though the Goſpel be the Miniſtration of the Spirit, and though all Chriſt's True Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are endued with the Spirit, yet he ſaw fit and neceſſary to leave them this ſtanding Directory for their Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>9. Prayer is a duty of a vaſt latitude and comprehenſion. For, within the bounds of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48822:229"/>
this exact pattern are compehended. 1. The Grand concernments of God. 2. Of our ſelves, both as to ſoul and body. 3. And of Others. <hi>viz.</hi> the Church, Nation, Neighbourhood, our Relations &amp;c. So much is imported in the word [<hi>Our</hi>]: which duely conſidered may 1. Warrant long praying upon occaſion, 2. And ſhew us our imperfections in Prayer.</p>
               <p>10. The Concernments of Gods glory and Kingdom ſhould have the preheminence above our own, in our deſires and prayers. This is plain from the Order of the Petitions.</p>
               <p>11. The matter of Prayers is not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our corrupt Paſſions, or blind fancies dictate to us, but what makes for Gods glory, our own or other good ſpiritual or temporal, with ſubordination to his glory. Within theſe bounds is the matter of the Lords Prayer circumſcribed, which calls upon us to take heed we offer not ſtrange fire, or ask we know not what, as they <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 38.</p>
               <p>12. Gods glory muſt be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of our Prayers. The Firſt Petition is, that his name be hallowed; the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is a Doxology, or aſcription of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power and glory</hi> to him. How ſeldom do we ſincerely and intentionally make it ſo? Theſe from the Connexion, Scope, and Matter, in general.</p>

Will the Papiſts ſay, They are included under the Title Father? <hi>But one is our Father which is in Heaven?</hi> Matth. 23. 9. Or will they charge our Saviour as a defective Teacher, or that out of envy he ſaid nothing of their Mediatours as intending to Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the whole of that Office to himſelf?

               </p>
               <p>2. The Name of God is peculiarly holy. [<hi>Name] i. e.</hi> both God himſelf and all thoſe manifeſtations of himſelf whereby he hath made himſelf known, whether his Attributes, Word, or Works. [<hi>Holy] i. e.</hi> pure, right, ſingularly excellent. [Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly] <hi>i. e.</hi> Eſſentially, ſo God himſelf, and eminently ſo all that whereby he hath manifeſted himſelf. This Obſervation is thus grounded: <hi>viz.</hi> To ſanctify his name, is not (as the word may ſeem to import) to make it holy, but to conceive, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profeſs it to be what indeed it is, that is, peculiarly holy: So that the holyneſs of Gods name is the grouud of our ſanctifying it: becauſe it is holy, we muſt ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it.</p>
               <p>3. Though God can ſanctify his name
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48822:231"/>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> manifeſt it to be holy and glorious) yet he will have us to teſtify our deſire by praying that He will ſanctify it. For this (as hath been explained) is one ſenſe of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>viz.</hi> that God will ſanctify his own name, vindicate his honour, and let out upon the world reſplendent beams of his own glory.</p>
               <p>4. The ſanctification of Gods name (that is, the declaring, acknowledging, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of his holineſs) ought to be the principal deſire and endeavour of every one that calls God Father. Therefore is this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the firſt in Order.</p>
               <p>5. We cannot ſanctify the name of God as we ought without enablement from God. Therefore we are taught to pray this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe our ability for it muſt come from God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>3. The bringing of Gods Kingdom into any place or upon any ſoul, muſt be Gods work. Therefore we are taught to pray to him for it, becauſe without him our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are vain.</p>
               <p>4, Though Gods general Kingdom be in all places, and at all times; yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike manifeſted: In this ſenſe we are taught to pray that <hi>his Kingdom may come. viz.</hi> that he will make it manifeſt, that to him belongs Dominion and power and glory <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. God hath, beſides his univerſal, a more ſpecial Kingdom, which comes not to all places, but whither and when himſelf pleaſeth. The coming of this Kingdom is moſt properly meant here, becauſe this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may come to a people <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 28. and be taken from them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43.</p>
               <p>6. The coming of Gods Kingdom is both a ſingular means to glorify God, and of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantage to thoſe amongſt whom it comes. The former, flowes from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this with the former Petition. The later hence, that Jeſus Chriſt teacheth us to ask nothing but what's for our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48822:232"/>7. Where the Kingdom of God is come yet we are to pray that it may come. This is not a Petition for Heathens only, but for Chriſtians, Diſciples, Beleevers of all ranks. And it is neceſſary, both. 1. To beg the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it. 2. The enlargement and fuller manifeſtation of it. 3. The conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it in glory; Till then, this Petition will not be out of date.</p>

               <head>III. PETITION.</head>
               <p>1. GOd's Will is the Law whereby his Kingdom is governed: and then is his Kingdom ſuid to come, when <hi>his Will is done.</hi> This is fairly imported in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of theſe two Petitions.</p>
               <p>2. Gods Will alone is abſolutely good, and juſt, and righteous. For upon this foundation ſtands the Petition; not only upon the meer Soveraignty of God whereby he can do what he pleaſeth, but upon the Rectitude of his Will, whereby he Can or Will do nothing but what is juſt.</p>
               <p>3. Man ought to lay aſide and utterly deny his own will as to any competition with Gods Will; yea, to bring his will to a ready compliance with Gods when he underſtands it, as <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 14. Elſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray this Petition, without notorious Hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>4. In prayer, all our Petitions are to have
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48822:232"/>
this (at leaſt implicite) reſervation, <hi>If the Lord Will,</hi> or, According to thy good pleaſure; or, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> For this Petition confines all the reſt of our Petitions within the bounds of Gods good pleaſure. In ſaying [<hi>thy Will be done</hi>] we in effect ſay, Lord, in all I ask, I ſubmit to thy Will, whether to give or with-hold it.</p>
               <p>5. Without the Grace of God enabling we can neither obey his <hi>Preceptive</hi> Will, nor ſubmit to his <hi>decretive</hi> Will as we ought, for therefore are we taught to pray thus, that God may enable us to do the one, and cheerfully ſubmit to the other.</p>
               <p>6. Every one that calls God Father ſhould not only be contented that Gods Will be done, but deſire and pray that it may be done by and upon himſelf and others. This is the ſcope of the Petition. Yet we muſt diſtinguiſh: It is Gods Will his Children ſhould be afflicted, yet we are not to pray for afflictions, but that, if his Will be to afflict us, we may patiently ſubmit <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. In Heaven the Will of God is done with much accurateneſs and readineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Chriſt, Angels, and glorified Saints. Therefore we are taught to pray that it may ſo be done on earth. How ſhould this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration make us ſigh out our deſire to be diſſolved?</p>
               <p>8. Perfection in obedience ſhould be our deſire, aim and endeavour, though in this life it cannot be our attainment: We are
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48822:233"/>
taught to pray, that our obedience may be like the Angels; though ſome will have it underſtood as to the quality of it, not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet I ſee no abſurdity to ſay, that we may deſire and wiſh and pray that we might arrive (if poſſible) at their perfection, for I conceive much of Evangelical perfection lies in hearty enlarged deſires and prayers after perfection. [<hi>Deus non vult nobis in hâc vitâ praeſtare liberationem à peccatis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectam; &amp; tamen vult nos eam optare, noſque ſingulis momentis petere ut omninò liberemur à peccatis</hi>] U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>9. While our commoration is on earth, we never arrive at that perfection but that we ſtill need to pray for ability to do and ſubmit to God's Will. For this Pattern is for the higheſt Schollars in Chriſt's School.</p>

               <p>1. IN Prayer we have liberty, next to the concernments of Gods name and glory, to commend our own both outward and ſpiritual concernments to God. Next. <hi>i. e.</hi> not ſo much in the order of our Petitions (for we may begin with our own) as in the ardour of our affections. This from the matter of the three laſt Petitions which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our ſelves.</p>
               <p>2. Whatever we ask for our ſelves muſt
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48822:233"/>
be with reference, and in ſubſerviency to the ſanctifying of Gods name, promoting of his Kingdom and doing his will. For the three former Petitions being abſolute, do confine the following Petitions within their Bounds.</p>
               <p>3. God will have us beg our dayly bread, and dayly beg it at his dore. This is the ſumme of the Petition.</p>
               <p>4. Even thoſe that have the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of worldly bleſſings, ſtill have need to beg their bread at the hands of God. This Petition is for the rich as well as the poor Chriſtians, and there's Reaſon ſufficient. For. 1. They cannot enjoy what they have without his bleſſing, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6. 2. 2. Neither will it be bread to them, <hi>Hagg. 1. 6. Deut.</hi> 8. 3. 3. Nor can they longer enjoy it than it pleaſeth God: he can ſtrip them in a moment. 4.

               <p>5. Neceſſaries only are to be askt of God: for under <hi>bread</hi> all, and only neceſſaries, are comprehended.</p>
               <p>6. We are not to deſire or beg any thing of God, but what we may lawfully call <hi>Our Bread:</hi> i. e. that which becomes ours by honeſt labour, or other lawful means, and which God hath appointed for us.</p>
               <p>7. Even that which becomes ours by our own induſtry, or by any other lawful way of getting; We are ſtill to acknowledg the

               <p>8. The care we take, or the Proviſion we lay in for the future, muſt be conſiſtent with a continual dependence upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God.

               <head>V. PETITION.</head>
               <p>1. THough temporal things may be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet we are not to dwell upon them, but to ariſe from them to ſpiritual things: Therefore hath our Saviour couch't the infinite neceſſities of this life in one ſingle Petition.</p>
               <p>2. Pardon of ſin is a mercy attainable, and one of the firſt and choiceſt we ſhould ask of God.</p>
               <p>3. Confeſſion of ſin is a requiſite condition in order to Pardon, for therefore are we taught to pray thus, that in ſo praying we may acknowledg, and paſs ſentence upon our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:48822:234"/>4. Man by ſin becomes a debtour to God, and ſtands bound to ſatisfy his juſtice. For in <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſins are called debts, and the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>Forgive,</hi> imports releaſment, cancelling a debt, diſmiſſing a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>5. Satisfaction for ſin is an impoſſibility, as to a mans ſelf. For, could ſatisfaction be made by any, this Petition as to ſuch would be unneceſſary, whereas it is to be put up by all: ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>6. Chriſt's ſatisfaction is no Contradiction to a free Pardon of ſin, but the Foundation of it: [no Contradiction] for even he that made the ſatisfaction, hath yet taught us to pray, Forgive us <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [The foundation of it] for though it be not mentioned in the Petition it is neceſſarily implyed. 1. In that we pray for pardon in ſubordination to Gods glory, but it cannot conſiſt with the glory of his Truth (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) to pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compenſation. 2. We pray for pardon in a way agreeable to Gods will, but this is by faith on Chriſt's ſatisfaction. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 10. 3. The Remiſſion which is here begged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Adoption (which Divines call the Relative<note place="margin">

Now 'tis certain, all theſe are procured by the Death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. See <hi>Rom. 5. 10. Phil. 3. 9. Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>7. All Chriſtians even of the higheſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments have need to pray dayly for the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48822:235"/>
Pardon of ſin. For this Petition (as the whole) is of general concernment. The grounds of this you may ſee in the expoſition.</p>
               <p>8. Men, while upon earth, will have need to forgive and be forgiven mutual Treſpaſſes and offences. So much is imported in that [<hi>as we forgive</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>9. It is Gods good pleaſure that they that expect mercy from him, ſhould ſhew mercy to others.</p>
               <p>10. A merciful reconcileable frame is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly pleaſing to God, and may be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to beg and hope for pardon at the hands of God. Theſe two are plain from the words.</p>

               <p>1. WE have need to pray as well for preſervation from ſin, as the pardon of it. Therefore is this Petition added to and conjoyned with the foregoing.</p>
               <p>2. Temptations are the great means whereby ſin is propagated in the world: <hi>i. e.</hi> whereby men are drawn into ſin and their corruptions are drawn out. Therefore when we ſhould pray to be kept from ſin, we are taught to ſay [<hi>Lead us not into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:48822:235"/>3s Man cannot be brought into a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation without Gods permiſſion and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For by Leading is imported both the permiſſive and ordering Providence of God. See the Expoſition.</p>
               <p>4. The beſt of men cannot keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of Temptation without Gods keeping: for [<hi>Lead us not into Temptation</hi>] is as much as, Keep us that we be not drawn into it, or run upon it.</p>
               <p>5. However we may not abſolutely pray to be kept out of Temptation, yet we ſhould be earneſt with God to keep us from the evil of it: for thus the later clauſe ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the former; <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord, if thy will be, keep us out of Temptation, but however keep us from the evil or hurt of it.</p>
               <p>6. To be preſerved from the evil of a Temptation, it is ſometimes neceſſary that we be pul'd out by violence. 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>8. Prayer is a ſingular means to keep us from Temptations, or from the evil of it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
               <p>9. God is the great and only Saviour and deliverer of his people from all kind of ſinful or ſorrowful evils: for though evils of ſin be eſpecially meant here; yet I doubt not but all other evils are alſo to be referred to this Place.</p>
